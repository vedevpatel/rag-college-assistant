As such, it is\n                        uniquely positioned to address the emerging needs of local residents and employers\n                        and respond to regional demographic, workforce, and economic trends.\nThe information contained the EMP presents great opportunities for Las Positas College\n                        in the midst of uncertainty and has informed the development of the following five\n                        overarching goals:\nEducational Excellence\nCommunity Collaboration\nSupportive Organizational Resources\nOrganizational Effectiveness\nEquity and Anti-Racism\nLas Positas College's EMP can be found at the following link:\nEducational Master Plan: 2021 to 2026 (pdf)\nEducational Master Plan: 2015 to 2020\nThe Las Positas College Educational Master Plan (EMP) articulates the institution\u2019s\n                        goals and strategies for advancing the college\u2019s mission. The plan guides the college\n                        in strengthening student achievement, planning for current and future needs, transforming\n                        infrastructure and informing the resource allocation process and staffing priorities.\nLas Positas College\u2019s EMP is primarily based on input and feedback received from faculty,\n                        staff and students on numerous occasions. A workshop was held at the regularly scheduled\n                        Town Hall Meeting on November 4, 2014 to get initial input into the college\u2019s EMP.\n                        A planning charrette was conducted on February 20, 2015 to provide additional input\n                        into Las Positas College\u2019s EMP. During May of 2015, Las Positas College hosted seven\n                        discussion/feedback sessions on campus regarding the draft EMP framework. The EMP\n                        was also discussed at a number of committee meetings. In addition, feedback received\n                        from faculty, staff, and administrators during the summer of 2015. Furthermore, external\n                        and internal environmental scans were conducted to inform the EMP.\nThe EMP meets student needs through long\u2010range planning of instructional and student\n                        support programs, facility and site planning needs and technological needs. The EMP\n                        was adopted by the Board of Trustees on November 17, 2015.\nEducational Master Plan: 2015-2020 (pdf)\nStrategic Plan: 2010 to 2015\nFollowing the revision of its Mission Statement, the creation of its Vision Statement,\n                        and the development of its Institutional Strategic Goals, Las Positas College engaged\n                        in a year-long strategic planning process during the 2009-2010 academic year.\u00a0 The\n                        goal was to engage the College community in a strategic planning process that was\n                        radically inclusive, that integrated institutional planning efforts, and that provided\n                        an opportunity to develop a collective vision for the organization.\nMore than 200 members of the campus community participated in this initiative through\n                        their involvement at Visioning Day and Flex Day, and the result is the Las Positas\n                        College Strategic Plan 2010-2015 \u2013 a plan that is strategic, dynamic, measurable,\n                        interconnected, and institutionalized.\nIn order to address student and community needs, the College developed a comprehensive\n                        Educational Master Plan to guide its growth from 2003 to 2010. Included in this planning\n                        process was a Facilities Modernization Program which, together with funding from a\n                        Bond approved by local voters, provided the roadmap and resources for the College\n                        build-out.\nThis expansion of the campus covered state-of-the-art facilities, including the now-completed\n                        Physical Education Complex, housing a gymnasium and instructional areas; the Multi-Disciplinary\n                        Building, providing more than 36,000-square-feet of classrooms, lecture hall, and\n                        lab space; the Aquatics Center, featuring two swimming pools for instruction, competition,\n                        and recreation; a multi-use athletic field; and a new parking lot, bringing 500 more\n                        parking spaces to campus. In addition, completed in 2010 were the College Center for\n                        the Arts \u2013 with a 500-seat theater, 1,500-seat amphitheater, and classroom space;\n                        and the modern Child Development Center for training new teachers as well as providing\n                        day care to 35 children.\nOther projects for completion in 2013 are expansion of the Science Building and a\n                        new Student Services and Administration Building at the center of the campus. With\n                        the convenience of the new Student Services offices and a new cafeteria in the middle\n                        of campus will come improvements of pathways, \"sticky space\" for students to gather\n                        outside, and attractive landscaping - called \"Campus Boulevard\".\nAs its enrollment continued to climb toward the estimated 12,000 students in 2010,\n                        Las Positas College once again embarked on the journey of writing its future history.\n                        This strategic planning process \u2013 involving faculty, staff, students, administrators,\n                        and community members \u2013 sets th e foundation for future directions, as well as the\n                        development and assessment of programs, services, and facilities at the institution.\nLas Positas College Strategic Plan 2010-2015 (pdf)\nFor information on the College's previous strategic planning efforts, follow the link\n                        below:\nLPC Educational Master Plan: 2003-2010 (pdf)\nQuestions or Comments?\n(925) 424-1000\nlpcpresidentsinfo\nUseful Links\nQuickLinks\nFacility Rentals\nCommunity Education\nOrganization Charts\nFaculty & Staff Directory"}

A course has a prerequisite\n                        to ensure that a student has the appropriate body of knowledge to successfully take\n                        the course. Courses with a co-requisite require that a student either has taken the\n                        co-requisite before or is taking it at the same time as the courses.\nUsually, a prerequisite is a course from a lower sequence of courses. For example:\n                        You may not enroll in Math 55 without first passing Math 65 with a \u201cC\u201d grade or better,\n                        or the equivalent. Usually, a co-requisite course is a lab or a course that provides\n                        supplemental instruction.\nTo see which courses have prerequisites and/or co-requisites refer to the individual\n                        course offerings in this Catalog or the\nLPC website\n.\nRequest for Course Substitution or Waiver of Program Requirement\nStudents who have had substantial prior experience related to the content of a college-level\n                        course, and who can present adequate evidence of their competence, may petition to\n                        have enrollment in that class waived without college credit for purposes of satisfying\n                        a program requirement. Courses considered for substitution must have been taken at\n                        an accredited institution. Petitions for course substitution or waiver of program\n                        requirements are available from the Counseling Center. Approval of the request by\n                        the Dean of Student Services is required prior to completing registration. Approval\n                        shall be based on the following criteria:\nAdequate evidence of competence as supported by transcripts, statements of employers,\n                           military or technical school certificates, etc.\nStatement from an instructor that the course reflects the appropriate subject matter\n                           and fulfills the necessary program requirements, and signature of the Division Dean\n                           to validate the course. Students shall be advised that courses waived receive neither\n                           unit nor grade credit and that other courses may be needed to satisfy the total number\n                           of units required to complete the program of study.\nClassification of Students Based on Unit Load\nThe following classifications have been established based on unit load:\nFull-time student\n- Registered for 12 or more units\nThree-quarter time student\n- Registered for 9.0 to 11.5 units\nHalf-time student\n- Registered for 6.0 to 8.5 units\nLimitation on Unit Load\nEighteen (18) units per semester are considered to be a maximum load for a student.\n                        In order to take more than the maximum, an approval form must be obtained from a counselor.\n                        The College reserves the right to place unit limit restrictions due to fiscal constraints.\nCourse Conflict/Course Overlap\nStudents may not enroll in two classes that meet during any part of the same hour.\nWithdrawing from Classes\nStudents are responsible for officially withdrawing from classes by the deadline date\n                        listed in the current Class Schedule. There is no automatic withdrawal process. Failure\n                        to follow the proper withdrawal procedures may result in a grade of \u201cF\u201d. Requests\n                        to withdraw from a class that are received by the \u201cNGR\u201d (No-Grade-of Record) deadline\n                        will not appear on a student\u2019s academic transcript. If a student withdraws from a\n                        course after the \u201cNGR\u201d deadline but on or before the \u201cW\u201d (withdrawal) deadline, a\n                        \u201cW\u201d will appear on their transcript. A \u201cW\u201d notation will not affect the student\u2019s\n                        grade point average; however, excessive \u201cW\u201d notations may affect: (1) progress status,\n                        (2) status as a full-time student, (3) eligibility for financial aid and other benefits,\n                        (4) athletic eligibility, or (5) ability to repeat a course (based on Title V regulations).\n                        Refer to the Class Schedule for important deadline dates.\nWithdrawing from the College\nStudents who intend to withdraw from the College must initiate withdrawal procedures\n                        for each class in which they are enrolled. Students are held accountable for clearing\n                        all obligations with the College including fees, library books, equipment, and lockers.\n                        The deadline for withdrawal from classes with a guaranteed symbol \u201cW\u201d is Friday of\n                        the twelfth instructional week. Refer to the Class Schedule for deadlines.\nInstructor\u2019s Withdrawal Option\nThe instructor may drop students who miss the first meeting of a course. In addition,\n                        an instructor may initiate a drop if the student is absent for a total of four (4)\n                        consecutive or six (6) cumulative instructional hours and/or two (2) consecutive weeks\n                        of instruction.\nInstructor\u2019s Withdrawal Option: Distance Education\nThe instructor may drop students who miss the first meeting of a course. The first\n                        meeting of online or hybrid Distance Education courses is the first day of the class\n                        as specified in the Class Schedule listing. For these courses, instructor may drop\n                        students who do not log into their Canvas course and/or complete indicated activities\n                        by the third day of classes. Distance Education instructors may drop students if they\n                        have not submitted work and/or accessed the class for two consecutive weeks.\nRepeating a Course\nThe College recognizes that the most recent completion of a course should most accurately\n                        reflect a student\u2019s academic progress. Therefore, students may repeat for credit those\n                        courses taken for which grades of D, F, NP, W were received. The most recent grade\n                        (A, B, C, D, F, P/NP) received must be calculated into the GPA regardless of whether\n                        this grade is lower or higher than the original grade.\nEffective Summer 2012, under the new Title 5 regulations, a student may only enroll\n                        in a course 3 times, through a combination of substandard grades (D, F, NP, or NC)\n                        and withdrawals (W). All prior course attempts at the ChabotLas Positas Community\n                        College District will count toward the limit. Students may seek approval to enroll\n                        in a course a 4th time through the petition process. The petition is limited to the\n                        following:\nIn extenuating circumstances, such as verified cases of accident or illness.\nDue to a significant lapse of time (3 years or more) and:\nThere is an established recency prerequisite established by the course curriculum;\n                                 or,\nThere is an established recency requirement as established by a transfer institution\nIn a variable unit or open entry/exit course that can only be completed once, but\n                           with multiple enrollments.\nFor cooperative work experience courses (up to 16 credit hours),\nFor special needs courses (continued need must be demonstrated for each enrollment).\nWhen repetition of a course is legally mandated.\nWhere there is a significant change in industry or licensure standards.\nWhen a student has repeated a course and earned a passing grade of A, B, C, D, or\n                        P, he or she may petition the Dean of Enrollment Services to count, for grade point\n                        calculation only, the most recently earned grade. The \u201cPetition For Use Of Most Recent\n                        Grade in a Repeated Class\u201d is available at the Office of Admissions and Records. Physical\n                        Education activity courses may not be repeated for a higher grade. Students are advised\n                        that both the original and subsequent grade will remain on their transcript and that\n                        in transferring to another institution, they may be held responsible for all units\n                        attempted.\nCourse Repetition: Special Circumstances\nStudents may not repeat a course in which they received a passing grade of A, B, or\n                        C. However, under specific conditions, the Dean of Student Services or designee may\n                        permit the repetition of courses for which a grade of \u201cC\u201d or better has been received.\n                        These conditions are:\nWhen the student\u2019s previous grade is, at least in part, the result of extenuating\n                           circumstances. Extenuating circumstances are verified cases of accident, illness or\n                           other circumstances beyond the control of the student;\nWhen a student should repeat a course because there has been a significant lapse of\n                           time since the student previously took the course;\nWhen it is necessary to meet a legally mandated training requirement as a condition\n                           of continued paid or volunteer employment.\nCalifornia Education Code (Title V, Section 55763) states that grades awarded for\n                        courses repeated under these specific conditions shall not be counted in calculating\n                        a student\u2019s grade point average.\nCollege Transcripts\nStudents who desire transcripts of their academic record must submit a written and\n                        signed request to the Office of Admissions and Records indicating the student\u2019s name\n                        used while attending, SSN or W identification number, and the number of transcripts\n                        requested and name and address of the designated recipient. Transcripts are provided\n                        only in response to a written request and signed from the student. Official transcripts\n                        will be mailed directly to the designated recipient.\nCopies of transcripts received from other colleges and universities cannot be forwarded\n                        to a third party. Students desiring such transcripts must request them directly from\n                        the issuing institution.\nAdmissions & Records Office\nLas Positas College\n3000 Campus Hill Drive\nBuilding 1600, Room 1670\nLivermore, CA 94551\nSpring 2025 Office/Window Hours\nMonday\n9:00 am \u2013 5:00 pm\nTuesday\n10:00 am \u2013 7:00 pm\nWednesday\n9:00 am \u2013 5:00 pm\nThursday\n9:00 am \u2013 5:00 pm\nFriday\n9:00 am \u2013 1:00 pm\nEmail:\nPlease send all Admissions and Records inquires via email to\nlpc-admissions@laspositascollege.edu\nCurrent students should email from their\nZonemail\nand include their W number.\nPhone:\n925-424-1500\nTell us about your experience with our office by completing a short student satisfaction\n      survey.

CCC Apply was designed by the\n                           Chancellor's Office. If it flags you as a NonResident you have the opportunity to\n                           appeal the status by filling out the Residency Reclassification Petition. This request,\n                           along with appropriate documentation, allows Las Positas College to modify your residency\n                           status when appropriate, while providing the required documentation for auditors.\nHow do I find my residency status:\nLogin to Classweb\nClick the \"Student Services\" tab\nSelect \"Check Priority Registration status\" link\nChoose college, select term, click submit.\nScroll down to \"Current Residency Classification.\"\nQuestions about residency? Visit the\nAdmissions website with zoom link\non Mondays between 10:00 am - 12:00 pm. Link is top right on the Admissions page.\n                        You may also email\nlpc-residency@laspositascollege.edu\nto set up a Zoom appointment.\nAll Personal emails about Residency must be through your secure Zone Mail account.\nEligibility\nAny person who is a high school graduate or equivalent thereof, or who is eighteen\n                        years of age or older and who can profit from the instruction, is eligible to apply\n                        for admission to Las Positas College.\nResidency Requirement\nIn determining tuition and enrollment fees, students fall under the following two\n                        categories:\nResidents:\nThose who have legally resided in California for at least one year and a day prior\n                        to the first day of a new semester or session. California State law requires that\n                        students give evidence of physical presence in California for one year and their intent\n                        to make California their home state for other than a temporary period.\nNon-Residents (out-of-state and international students):\nThose who do not meet the California Residency requirements as previously outlined.\n                        Please refer to Student Fees, Tuition, & Refunds for cost of attendance.\nStudents who are California residents pay in-state tuition of $46 per unit, whereas\n                        students who are non-residents pay\nout-of-state tuition\nin addition to that charge. Community college enrollment fees are set by the California\n                        State Legislature. All fees are subject to change.\nThe term \"California resident\" for fee purposes may differ from other definitions\n                        of California residency. A person who has a California driver's license and/or vehicle\n                        registration or who is a California resident for tax, voting, or welfare purposes\n                        may have established legal residence in the state but not necessarily be considered\n                        a resident for fee purposes.\nResident Eligibility:\nTo be eligible for California residency, a student must do the following:\nThe following visa status holders cannot establish residency regardless of the length\n                                       of time in California: B-1, B-2, C, D-1, D-2, F-1, F-2, H-2, H-3, J-1, J-2, M-1, M-2,\n                                       O-2, P-1, P-2, P-3, P-4, Q, and TN/TD.\nIf you are the holder of one of these types of visas \u2013 but you have filed for a change\n                                       of status \u2013 then you may submit a request for residency reclassification. Your residency\n                                       determination date is based on the date of your application of change of status. Make\n                                       sure to include a copy of the Notice of Action from USCIS for the status adjustment.\nThe first day of the semester is the residency determination date. Living in California\n                                       for 12 months does not automatically qualify you for in-state tuition fees.\nUnder California law, if you moved to California primarily to attend a California\n                                       college, then you are not eligible for in-state tuition fees.\nYou must prove through official and/or legal documents that you have moved to California\n                                       permanently and are not just living in California temporarily while you attend college,\n                                       however long your course of study takes.\nStudents under 19 years of age and unmarried typically derive California residency\n                                       from their parents. The parents must meet the eligibility requirements and provide\n                                       documentation demonstrating physical presence in California and intent to make California\n                                       their permanent residence. Note: Students older than 19 usually\ndo not\nderive residency from a parent.\nAlternatively, students seeking reclassification from non-resident to resident status\n                                       can show financial independence from any non-resident parent or guardian according\n                                       to guidelines set forth by the State of California.\nTo establish financial independence, a student seeking reclassification must show\n                                       the extent to which they have met the following criteria for the current and each\n                                       of the immediately preceding three (3) calendar years:\nThe student has not been claimed as an exemption for state or federal tax purposes\n                                          by their non-resident parents.\nThe student has not received more than $750 from their non-resident parents.\nThe student has not lived in the home of their non-resident parents for more than\n                                          six weeks in any given year.\nFailure to satisfy all the financial independence criteria for the entire period will\n                                       not necessarily result in classification as a non-resident if the showing of one year\u2019s\n                                       presence and intent is sufficiently strong. However, failure to satisfy all three\n                                       financial independence criteria for the current and immediately preceding calendar\n                                       years will normally result in classification as a non-resident, since financial independence\n                                       is of greater significance for those years.\nFinancial independence, or want of it, for the second and third calendar years immediately\n                                       preceding the year in which reclassification is requested will be considered together\n                                       with all other relevant factors in determining intent, with no special weight attached\n                                       to the financial independence factor. Evidence of financial independence may be presented\n                                       in the form of:\nAffidavits signed by student and parent indicating the extent to which the three criteria\n                                          listed above have been met\nCopies of the federal and state income tax returns filed by student and/or parent\n                                          for the current and any applicable preceding calendar years\nLearn about\nexemptions and special considerations\n.\nHow to Apply for Reclassification of Residency\nWe encourage students to start the residency reclassification process before they\n                           sign up for classes. If you don't pay your fees on time because you are trying to\n                           get in-state tuition, then you may be dropped from your classes.\nWe have updated our Residency Reclassification Petition to Adobe Sign. We feel this\n                           will be a more effective way to serve you better.\nVideo: Here are some tips for completing the Residency Reclassification form.\nSubmit the completed\nResidency Reclassification Petition\nthrough Adobe Sign along with all the required documents.\nPaper copies will not be accepted. Please do not send us a copy of your Residency\n                              Reclassification Petition; we automatically receive it when you fill out your Adobe\n                              Sign Petition.\nNOTE: Your Residency Classification will not be changed automatically, you must request\n                              it.

The primary factor in student success, however, is the student's\n                        devotion of considerable time and energy to the learning process. A high grade in\n                        a Las Positas College course is, therefore, something of which both the college and\n                        the student can be proud. It indicates mastery of the material achieved through hard\n                        work.\nAny form of academic dishonesty, whether cheating or plagiarism, undermines the value\n                        of grades for the entire student body and the College as a whole. It is an affront\n                        to every student who has labored to achieve success honestly and a threat to the College's\n                        reputation for academic excellence. For these reasons, the College does not tolerate\n                        any form of academic dishonesty. Any student attempting to gain an unfair advantage\n                        in a course will be severely penalized, up to and including suspension from classes.\n                        The actions taken against the student will also be permanently entered into the student's\n                        record in the case of repeated, flagrant, or serious incidents.\nFor purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply:\nCheating is defined as fraud, deceit, or dishonesty in an academic assignment. It\n                        may involve:\nCopying or attempting to copy from others during an examination or for an assignment;\nCommunicating examination information to, or receiving such information from, another\n                           person during an examination;\nPreprogramming a calculator or computer to contain answers or other unauthorized information\n                           for examinations;\nUsing, attempting to use, or assisting others in using materials that are prohibited\n                           or inappropriate in the context of the academic assignment or examination in question,\n                           such as: books, Web sites, prepared answers, written notes, or concealed information;\nAllowing others to do one's assignment or a portion of one's assignment or using a\n                           commercial term paper service;\nAllowing someone else access to your secure online classroom to complete assignments\n                           or portions of assignments;\nGaining unauthorized access to another student\u2019s online classroom account;\nAltering examination answers after an assignment has been completed or altering recorded\n                           grades; and\nResubmitting a previously written assignment for a new course without the permission\n                           of the instructor.\nPlagiarism is defined as using another's work (whether printed, electronic, or spoken)\n                        without crediting him or her. Whereas cheating is almost always intentional, students\n                        sometimes plagiarize accidentally. It is vital, therefore, for students to understand\n                        the many different kinds of actions that constitute plagiarism:\nSubmitting the whole of another's work as one's own (see the definition of \"cheating\"\n                           above: this includes submitting another student's paper or a paper obtained from a\n                           commercial term paper service as one's own);\nUsing the exact wording of a source without putting that wording in quotation marks\n                           and citing it;\nParaphrasing the wording of a source without citing it;\nInadequately paraphrasing the wording of a source (not only the words, but the sentence\n                           structure of the original must be changed);\nSummarizing the ideas of a source without citing it; and\nOverusing the ideas of a source, so that those ideas make up the majority of one's\n                           work.\nFrom discipline to discipline and course to course, students will find that instructors\n                        will sometimes use teaching tools like modeling (in which the student is asked to\n                        \"model\" his or her writing after another's) or collaboration (in which students co-write\n                        or share ideas for an assignment) that seem very close to plagiarism. In cases like\n                        these, the instructor will be very careful to emphasize that the \"use of another's\n                        work\" is occurring within the specific parameters of the assignment.

Gently rolling hills\n                        and picturesque vineyards provide the scenic background for the College's 147-acre\n                        campus.\nLas Positas College began as an extension center of Chabot College in 1963, offering\n                        24 classes and enrolling 810 students at Livermore High School and two other sites.\n                        By 1965, the program had expanded and moved to Granada High School in Livermore. It\n                        subsequently grew to include Amador and Dublin High Schools as well. The District\n                        purchased the Livermore site that same year, intending to develop a comprehensive\n                        community college. On March 31, 1975, \u201cValley Campus\u201d opened as the Livermore Education\n                        Center of Chabot College.\nIn 1988, the College was designated by the Board of Governors to be an independent\n                        college and on January 7, 1991, LPC received full accreditation from the Accrediting\n                        Commission for Community and Junior Colleges.\nOverview\nLas Positas College currently enrolls nearly 8,500 day and evening students. The College\n                        offers curriculum for students seeking career preparation, transfer to a four-year\n                        college or university, or personal enrichment. The College provides university transfer\n                        classes, retraining classes for those in need of employment or career advancement,\n                        a first-time educational opportunity for many adults, enrichment classes for those\n                        seeking a broader perspective, and career and technical training for those entering\n                        the technical and paraprofessional work force. Las Positas College excels in helping\n                        students transfer to the University of California system, the California State University\n                        system, and other four-year institutions.\nStudents who come to the College can choose any of 24 Occupational Associate Degrees,\n                        17 Transfer Associate Degrees, and 44 Certificate Programs. In addition, the College\n                        offers community education courses geared toward personal development and cultural\n                        enrichment.\nAcademic rigor is maintained in a friendly, personal atmosphere. Las Positas College\n                        faculty and staff are distinguished by their energy, creativity, and commitment to\n                        making a difference in the lives of the students they serve.\nLas Positas College is a learning-centered institution focused on excellence and student\n                        success, and is fully committed to supporting all Tri-Valley residents in their quest\n                        for education and advancement.\nThe campus is accessible from BART and Interstate 580. Students can take buses from\n                        the Pleasanton-Dublin BART station and from many locations in Livermore and Pleasanton.\n                        The College is proud of its exceptional safety record, which has made it one of the\n                        safest colleges in the Bay Area, and its commitment to sustainability, including LEED\n                        facilities, recycling and paper reduction practices, and photovoltaic (solar) parking\n                        structures generating one megawatt of energy.\nLas Positas College Presidents\nDean, Valley Campus - Barbara M.

It\n                        subsequently grew to include Amador and Dublin High Schools as well. The District\n                        purchased the Livermore site that same year, intending to develop a comprehensive\n                        community college. On March 31, 1975, \u201cValley Campus\u201d opened as the Livermore Education\n                        Center of Chabot College.\nIn 1991 the first full graduating class was honored at Convocation. There were 5 buildings\n                        on the west end of campus and Convocation was held on the lawn to the west (in front\n                        of) the current Building 700.\nWhat Does \"Las Positas\" Mean?\nThe Spanish word \"pozos\" means springs. The early Tri Valley settler, Robert Livermore,\n                        named his homestead \"Las Positas\", as it had a nice spring running through it. This\n                        was apparently his own form of Spanish to mean \"The Springs.\" Livermore was born and\n                        raised in an English village named Springfield, in Essex. The village still has the\n                        Livermore family home \"Springfield House\", thus a connection to his home village was\n                        in the name \"Las Positas.\"\nRobert Livermore married the widow Maria Josefa de Jesus Higuera on 5 May 1838, daughter\n                        of Jos\u00e9 Loreto Higuera, a grantee of Rancho Los Tularcitos. She was a member of the\n                        Higuera and Bernal families. Some of her elders were in the Spanish party accompanying\n                        De Anza into Norte California in 1775-76.\nCredit: Janet Newton, \"Las Positas, the Store of Robert and Josefa Livermore,\" 1969.\nQuestions or Comments?\n(925) 424-1000\nlpcpresidentsinfo\nUseful Links\nQuickLinks\nFacility Rentals\nCommunity Education\nOrganization Charts\nFaculty & Staff Directory"}

\n1 \nJeanne Clery Act \u2013 Annual Security Report (ASR) \nThe Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime \nStatistics Act, codified at 20 USC 1092 (f) as a part of the Higher Education Act of \n1965, is a federal law that requires colleges and universities to disclose certain \ntimely and annual information about campus crime and security policies. All \npublic and private institutions of postsecondary education participating in federal \nstudent aid programs are subject to it. Can be \"fined\" up to $54,789 by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education, the agency charged with enforcement of the Act and \nwhere complaints of alleged violations should be made, or face other \nenforcement action. \nNote \u2010 U .S. Department of Education Headquarters On April 20, 2022 the U.S. \nDepartment of Education increased fines for violating the Jeanne Clery Act from \n$59,017 to $62,689. Pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment \nAct Improvements Act of 2015 the Department is required to adjust fines for \ninflation each year. \nThe Clery Act, originally enacted by the Congress and signed into law by President \nGeorge Bush in 1990 as the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990, \nstemmed from Howard & Connie Clery after their daughter Jeanne was raped and \nmurdered at Lehigh University in 1986. They also founded the non\u2010p\nrofit Security \nOn Campus, Inc. in 1987. Amendments to the Act in 1998 renamed it in memory \nof Jeanne Clery. On March 07, 2013, President Obama signed the Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA) which amended the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965, the Clery Act. All higher education institutions are now \nrequired to compile statistics for incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault, and stalking. VAWA also requires higher education institutions to \ninclude policies, procedures, and programs pertaining to these incidents in the \nannual security report.  The complete text of the Clery Act and U.S. Department of \nEducation regulations is available on the Las Positas College Campus Safety \ndepartment link h\nttp://www.laspositascollege.edu/safety/, click on the Clery \nHandbook link. \n2 \nThe published Annual Security Report must be completed and updated every year \nby October 1st and contain 3 years\u2019 worth of campus crime statistics and certain \nsecurity policy statements. The Las Positas College Department of Campus Safety \npublishes this report in compliance with this requirement.  \nPreparation of the Annual Security Report \nLas Positas College Campus Safety Department prepares this report using \ninformation provided by other District and College offices such as Student \nServices, the Title IX Coordinator, and other Campus Security Authorities as well \nas information provided by local law enforcement agencies surrounding each of \nthe campuses. Each of these offices provides updated policy information and \ncrime data.  \nThis report provides statistics for the previous three years concerning reported \ncrimes that occurred on campus, in certain off\u2010c\nampus buildings or property \nowned, leased or controlled by the District. You may contact the Livermore Police \nDepartment for crime statistics on public property adjacent to the campus at \n(925) 371\u20104 900 .Public property statistics may also be found on file in a report at \nthe Department of Campus Safety office located in room 1725.   \nDistribution of the Annual Security Report \nCurrently enrolled and prospective students are sent an e\u2010mail by the Las Positas \nCollege Admissions and Records Department annually in late September which \ncontains a link to the ASR webpage. The ASR contains Las Positas College crime \nstatistics and other relevant safety/security information. \nThe Annual Security Report is a link located on the Campus Safety website at: \nh\nttp://www.laspositascollege.edu/safety/. Faculty and staff members are also \nsent out a campus wide email around mid\n\u2010O\nctober every year via the Las Positas \nCollege email. The Human Resources Department provides the ASR disclosure \nreport link information during new employee orientation.  \n3 \nUpon request, a paper copy of the report may also be obtained at the Las Positas \nCollege Campus Safety department, in building 1700 room 1725, by calling (925) \n424\u201016\n90.  \nCampus Security Authorities  \nA Campus Security Authority (CSA) is a campus employee, volunteer, or other \nofficial with significant responsibility for campus and student activities. A CSA has \nresponsibilities under the Clery Act to report information for timely warnings and \ncampus crime statistics. \nCSA training is mandatory for all CSAs and is designed to educate and inform \nthem of their responsibilities as a CSA under the Clery Act regulations. In addition \nto police officers and certain administrators, faculty and other staff that have \nsignificant responsibilities for student activities are all designated as CSAs. Las \nPositas College has identified the following groups or individuals as CSA: \n\u2022 The Las Positas College Campus Safety Department and its employees \nincluding officers, dispatchers. \n\u2022 Any official of Las Positas College who has a significant responsibility for        \nstudent and campus activities. \n\u2022 The Dean of Athletics and All athletic coaches, for all sports \n\u2022 Director, Student Life and Leadership Programs \n\u2022 Coordinators of clubs and affairs \n\u2022 Director of Campus Health / Counselling Center \n\u2022 Faculty and staff advisors for clubs \n\u2022 Faculty and staff advisors for academic and social clubs \n\u2022 Title IX Coordinator \n\u2022 Student Conduct, Rights and Responsibilities staff \n4 \nWhen a campus security authority receives crime information that he/she \nbelieves was provided in good faith, (little or no reason to doubt the validity of \nthe information) the CSA has the duty to immediately report the crime \ninformation to the Las Positas College Campus Safety Department by calling (925) \n424\u201016\n90 or dialing 911 in an emergency. \nA Message from the Campus Safety Supervisor \nWelcome to Las Positas College, \nThe Las Positas College Department of Campus Safety would like to welcome all \nstudents, faculty, staff, guests, and visitors to the Las Positas College campus.

Prather \nDepartment Supervisor, Campus Safety & Security Las Positas College \n5 \nStatement of Enforcement Authority for Campus Security Department \nThe Campus Safety officer meets the legal definition of a security officer because \nof appointment pursuant to the California Education Code, section 70902. The \nCampus Safety officer is not a peace officer, but sections 626 and 627 of the \nCalifornia Penal Code provide special authority for school security officers to \nmake an arrest if the perpetrator fails to leave the college grounds after being \ndirected to do so. In addition to this authority, Campus Safety Officers can arrest \nfor any misdemeanor or felony committed within their presence, but must use \nsection 837 P.C. \u2013 arrest by a private person \u2013 to accomplish the arrest. \nCampus Safety Officers derive additional authority from section 21113(a) of the \nCalifornia Vehicle Code. This section covers parking on school property. Officers \ncan issue citations for violations of District Parking Regulations using this section. \nMutual Agreement with the Livermore Police Department \nLas Positas College and the Livermore Police Department have entered into a \nmemorandum of understanding to define their respective campus safety and law \nenforcement roles relating to Las Positas College. \nUnder the guidelines of this agreement, the College Department of Campus \nSafety/Security is responsible for maintaining safety and security on campus.  \nThese duties include routine patrols, parking enforcement, reporting safety \nhazards, and writing various reports involving criminal activity, student and staff \ninjuries and non\u2010injury vehicle collisions.  The Livermore Police Department is \nresponsible for investigating all felony, serious misdemeanors and violent crimes \non campus, vehicle collisions, and taking custody of persons arrested per Section \n6 \n847 of the California Penal Code. \nWhere to Find Us \nThe Las Positas College Safety and Security Department public office is located in \nroom #1725 in building 1700. This office is open from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. \nMonday through Friday. If the office is closed, the on\u2010d\nuty safety officer can be \ncontacted by telephone in the following ways: \n\u2022 Activate any one of the emergency call boxes located throughout the \ncampus.  \n\u2022 Dial extension 1699 from any college phone.  \n\u2022 F\nrom any off\n\u2010c\nampus telephone dial (925) 424\u201016\n99. \nThe Las Positas College Campus Safety Services \nSpecial Services \nThe Campus Safety Department offers a variety of services and programs to help \npromote the personal safety needs and the security of the community. These \nservices are extended to all members and guests of our campus community. \nSome of our services are listed below: \nCrime Prevention and Safety Services \nThe Department offers a variety of crime prevention programs and services. All \nof these programs may be tailored to individual or group needs. Specially \ntrained personnel are available to students, staff, faculty or other community \nmembers. Personal safety, property security, security surveys and information \nregarding crime statistics are only a few of the programs and services available. \n7 \nSafety Escort Service \nSafety escort services are available to students, staff, faculty and visitors, at any \ntime and given by safety officers or student assistants. When you are ready to \nbe escorted, simply give us a call and we will safely escort you to your on\u2010\ncampus destination. You may call the department from any courtesy phone, \noffice phone, or the conveniently located \"call boxes\" (call boxes are red with a \nblue  light above them so that they can be easily seen and located). \nFound Property \nThe Department is designated as the official campus location for receipt and \nstorage of lost and found property. To inquire about an item lost on campus, \nplease contact the Department in person or by telephone. \nReporting Crimes and Emergencies \nAccurate and Prompt Reporting \nWe encourage all community members, including students, faculty, staff, and \nguests to report all crimes and public safety related incidents to the Department \nof Campus Safety in a timely manner. If assistance is required from a local police \ndepartment, fire or EMS, we will contact the appropriate service.  \nIf a sexual assault or rape should occur, staff on the scene, including Campus \nSafety, will offer the victim a wide variety of services and options for filing a \nreport. Crimes should be reported to the Department of Campus Safety to ensure \ninclusion in the annual crime statistics and to aid in providing timely warning \nnotices to the community, when appropriate your report may prevent someone \nelse from becoming a victim. Reporting criminal incidents or emergencies and \nrequests for police services, may be initiated by an in\u2010person visit to our office or \nby a telephone call. For emergencies dial 9\u20101\u20101. If calling from a call box, simply \npush the red button an officer will be dispatched immediately to that location. \n8 \nThe Campus Safety department encourages the reporting of all campus criminal \nactivity directly to the Department; however, in some instances members of the \ncampus community may feel more comfortable reporting criminal activity to a \nCampus Security Authority (CSA) other than the local police department. For Clery \npurposes, a crime is considered \u201creported\u201d when it is brought to the attention of \na Campus Security Authority by anyone (victim, witness, offender, second/third \nparty) whether or not they are affiliated with the campus Individuals who would \nnot meet the criteria for being campus security authorities include faculty \nmembers who do not have any responsibility for student and campus activity \nbeyond the classroom, clerical staff and cafeteria staff. A physician in a campus \nhealth center or a counselor in a counseling center whose only responsibility is to \nprovide care to students is unlikely to have significant responsibility for student \nand campus activity. \nExemption:  Per Clery, licensed professional mental health/pastoral counselors \nare not required to report; however they should inform persons they are \ncounseling of the procedures to voluntarily report crimes and/or the procedures \nthat would allow for the counselor to file a statistical report with the police \ndepartment (see \u201cConfidential Reporting\u201d). \n Pastoral Counselor: A person who is associated with a religious order or \ndenomination is recognized by that religious order or denomination as someone \nwho provides confidential counseling, and is functioning within the scope of that \nrecognition as a pastoral counselor. [Clery Handbook, pg. 77] \nProfessional Counselor: A person whose official responsibilities includes providing \nmental health counseling to members of the institution\u2019s community and who is \nfunctioning within the scope of his/her license or certification. [Clery Handbook \npg.77] \nWhen a campus security authority receives crime information that he/she \nbelieves was provided in good faith, (little or no reason to doubt the validity of \nthe information) the CSA has the duty to immediately report the crime \ninformation to the Campus Safety department. \n9 \n\u2022 If the victim survivor does not want to \u201creport\u201d the crime to the police \ndepartment, the CSA must advise him/her that for statistical purposes, you are \nrequired to report the incident but can do that without disclosing any personally \nidentifying information. \n\u2022 Do not attempt to convince or force the crime victim to make a report to \nthe police department. \nA CSA is not responsible for authoritatively determining whether a crime actually \ntook place, such a determination is the function of law enforcement. \nConfidential Crime Reporting  \nThe Campus Safety Department accepts reports of criminal activity in \nconfidence. This particularly applies to crimes of sexual violence and allows \nthe victim to report through a third party and/or remain anonymous. We \naccept reporting anywhere on campus you feel comfortable, such as the \nOffice of the Vice President of Student Services or any campus \nadministrative office. Whenever possible and pursuant to Penal Code \u00a7293, \nthe Campus Safety Department withholds information that may identify \nvictims of crime or other activity. It is our goal to provide assistance \nwherever the report is made and to ensure that we include the appropriate \ncrime information in our annual security report. \nIf victims do not wish to file a report, they, or others acting on their behalf, \ncan report crimes informally and confidentially (no names or criminal \ninvestigation) to any CSA.  In general, reports from CSAs are confidential, \nunless the victim gives permission to document identifying information or \nfor police to investigate. This information is used to compile statistics, to \navoid duplicate or inaccurate statistical reporting, and to assign reports to \nappropriate Clery Act crime classifications. Only statistical information \nobtained from these confidential reports will be included as part of the \nAnnual Campus Security Report. \n10 \nDaily Crime Log Access  \nLas Positas College Campus Safety Department maintains a daily crime log of all \ncrimes reported or investigated by the department for at least 60\u2010d\nays. The log is \navailable for public inspection during normal business hours of 8:00 A.M.\u201010:\n00 \nP.M. Monday \u2013 Friday, or asking for a print out in the Campus Safety Department \nin building 1700 room 1725.  \nEmergencies \nCrimes in progress and serious crimes which have just occurred should be \nreported by calling 1699 from any phone. Whenever possible, the actual victim or \nwitness of the crime should call directly. First hand information is always more \naccurate and complete. Prompt and accurate reporting of emergencies is \nessential for effective response by police and/or other emergency personnel. It is \nimportant to provide the following information: \n1. Exact location \n2. Nature of the emergency \n3. Injuries or medical issues \n4. Number of people involved \n5. Description of involved parties and/or vehicles \nNon Emergencies \nIncidents, security reports, and general safety and security issues that do not \nrequire an emergency response should be reported directly to the Campus Safety \nDepartment using the non\u2010emergency telephone number (925) 424\u201016\n90. \nClery Timely Warnings \nIn an effort to provide timely notice to the campus community in the event of a \nClery Act crime that may pose a serious or ongoing threat to members of the \ncommunity, Las Positas College Campus Safety Department will issue out a \n\u201cTimely Warning.\u201d The Campus Safety department will generally issue these \nwarnings for the following crimes: criminal homicide; sexual assaults; robbery; \naggravated assault; arson; burglary; and hate crimes. Campus Safety will post \n11 \nthese warnings through a variety of ways, including but not limited to e\u2010mails, \nposters or bulletins, and class discussions. The purpose of these warnings is to \nnotify the campus community of the incident and to provide information that may \nenable community members to protect themselves from similar incidents. \nCampus Safety will issue these warnings whenever the following criteria are met: \n\u2022 1.  A crime is committed; \n\u2022 2. The perpetrator has not been apprehended; and \n\u2022 3. There is a substantial and on\u2010going risk to the physical safety of \nother members of the campus community because of this crime. Such \ncrimes include, but are not limited to: Clery Act crimes that are reported to \nany campus security authority or the local police; or when the college \ndetermines that the incident represents an on\u2010going threat to the campus \ncommunity. Additionally, the Campus Safety department may, in some \ncircumstances, issue warnings when there is a pattern of crimes against \npersons or property. The Campus Safety Supervisor or designee will \ngenerally make the determination, in consultation with the President, if a \nwarning is required. However, in emergency situations, any Campus Safety \nofficer may authorize a Clery Timely Warning. For incidents involving off \ncampus crimes, the college may issue a Crime Advisory if the crime \noccurred in a location used and frequented by the college population. Clery \nTimely Warnings are sent out to the campus community via the Everbridge \nsystem. If you have an official Las Positas College email address, you are \nautomatically enrolled in the crime alert notification system. These \nmessages are a very effective way to important information to the campus \ncommunity about safety and congestion in the campus areas. \nEmergency Notification \nThe Las Positas College Campus safety department, is committed to ensuring that \nour campus community receives timely, accurate, and useful information in the \nevent of a significant emergency or dangerous situation on campus or in the local \narea that poses an immediate threat to the health and safety of campus \ncommunity members. Las Positas College uses the emergency notification system \n\u201cEverbridge\u201d which is an emergency notification service that proactively contacts \nstudents, staff and faculty at their district assigned e\u2010mail. Everbridge can be used \nto send emergency messages within minutes of the occurrence of an incident. \nMessages are sent by multiple methods to contact information listed in the \n12 \ncampus directory as well as confidential contact information registered by users. \nThe system can send simultaneous messages to the college community by e\u2010m\nail \nand SMS text. Campus community members can contact the Campus Safety \ndepartment to update or change their contact information and are encouraged to \nlist \u201cSMS Text\u201d as their primary contact method.  \nConfirming the Existence of a Significant Emergency or Dangerous \nSituation and Initiating the Emergency Notification System \nThe Campus Safety department/or other campus stakeholders may become \naware of a critical incident or other emergency situation that potentially affects \nthe health and/or safety of the campus Community. Generally, campus first \nresponders become aware of these situations when they are reported to the \nCampus Safety or upon discovery during patrol or other assignments. In the event \nof an emergency, the Campus Safety department will notify affected members of \nthe campus community without delay, taking into account the safety of the \ncommunity unless issuing a notification will, in the professional judgment of the \nCampus Safety Supervisor or their designees, compromise efforts to assist a \nvictim or to contain, respond to, or otherwise mitigate the Emergency. If, in the \nprofessional judgment of first responders, issuing a notification potentially \ncompromises efforts to assist a victim or to contain, respond to, or otherwise \nmitigate the Emergency, the college may elect to delay issuing an emergency \nnotifications. As soon as the condition that may compromise efforts is no longer \npresent, the Campus Safety department will issue the emergency notification to \nthe campus community. \nDetermining the Contents of the Emergency Notification \nThe Campus Safety Department, will determine the contents of the notification \nbased on each situation. The college has developed a wide range of template \nmessages addressing several different emergency situations. The individual \nauthorizing the alert will select the template message most appropriate to the \nongoing situation and modify it to address the specifics of the present incident. In \nthose cases where there are no predetermined template messages in the system, \nthe individual authorizing the alert will develop the most significant message to \nconvey the appropriate information to the community. The goal is to ensure that \n13 \nindividuals are aware of the situation and they know the steps to take to \nsafeguard their personal and community safety. \nEmergency Evacuation Procedures \nThe manner in which Las Positas College conducts emergency operations on \ncampus is governed by State and Federal legislation. The ability to declare a \ncampus State of Emergency is governed by Las Positas College district policy. \nUsually, such a declaration will be made upon the recommendation of the \nemergency operations center with the advice of the Campus Safety director and \nother administrators. The Las Positas College Emergency Operations Plan fulfills \nthe responsibilities to adhere to the: \n\u2022 Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS). \n\u2022 Incident Command System (ICS). \n\u2022 National Incident Management System (NIMS). \nThe overall objective of emergency management is to ensure the effective \nmanagement of response resources in preparing for and responding to situations \nassociated with catastrophic emergencies. To carry out its responsibilities, the \nemergency operation center will accomplish the following objectives during an \nemergency/disaster: \n\u2022 Support and coordinate emergency response and recovery operations. \n\u2022 Coordinate and work with appropriate federal, state, and local government \nagencies, as well as applicable segments of the private sector, monitor \nresource needs and coordinate requests for resources from outside \nagencies and jurisdictions. \n\u2022 Establish priorities and resolve any conflict demands for support. \n\u2022 Prepare and disseminate emergency public information to alert, warn, and \ninform the campus \n\u2022 Collect and disseminate damage information and other essential data \nabout the situation. Fulfill our obligation for intelligence gathering and \ninformation flow as described in SEMS, NIMS, and other procedures. \n14 \n\u2022 Provide logistical support for the emergency response. \nIn a campus\u2010wide emergency, the decision to implement evacuation procedures \nrests with the emergency operations center, if the emergency operation center is \nactivated. In situations requiring immediate action, public safety responders \n(Police/Fire) can also order a local area evacuation. When evaluating possible \nevacuation, consideration will be given to the specific threat (bomb, fire, storm, \nearthquake, explosion, hazardous materials incident, etc.), its context (time of \nday, likelihood, etc.), and the recommendation of the public safety officials. In a \nmajor earthquake, individuals should \u201cduck, cover, and hold\u201d until the shaking \nstops, and then evacuate the building if necessary. \nThe procedures for a campus\u2010wide evacuation will vary, depending on the nature \nof the event. In all cases when the decision has been made to evacuate, the \ncampus will likely be evacuated in stages, beginning with the areas that are in the \nimmediate vicinity of the threat. Other areas may then be evacuated, depending \non the nature of the threat. This graduated evacuation is preferable to a total, \nimmediate evacuation, as it triages the populations most in danger, minimizes \nlikelihood of gridlock and congestion, and provides for ingress of emergency \nvehicles and personnel. In all cases, evacuees would be directed away from the \nvicinity of the threat. \nThe emergency operations center will initially focus on the dissemination of \ninformation and instructions to the people at risk on the campus. For some \nhazards the campus may have only a few minutes to alert those at risk. Pre\u2010\nscripted information may go out with the initial warning. These messages will be \nfollowed up with what is happening, what the response organization (police, fire, \netc.) is doing, and what else the campus should do for its safety. The emergency \noperation center will feed preparedness information into an established media\u2010\npublic link, and give updates to the media and the campus after impact. If, in the \nprofessional judgment of responsible authorities, a notification would \ncompromise efforts to assist a victim or to contain, respond to or otherwise \nmitigate the emergency, a notification will not be issued. \n15 \nThe approval level of emergency notifications will be time\u2010dependent and \ndetermined by the incident. Authorization to send campus\u2010wide notifications will \nbe provided from the highest level listed below as circumstances permit.  \nNotifications involving immediate life safety issues may need to be sent on short \nor no notice without full authorization. \na. Executive Management Team and/or President. \nb. Vice President of Administration and Finance or designee. \nc. Campus Safety Supervisor and/or Environmental Health & Safety Director or \ndesignees. \nd. On Duty campus safety officers. \ne. Incident Commander. \nRegistered Sex Offenders /Megan's Law Information \nIn 1995, a convicted child molester was arrested for the rape and murder of 7\u2010\nyear\u2010old Megan Kanka in a New Jersey suburb. The offender lived across the \nstreet from the Kanka residence; however, the police department was prohibited \nfrom disclosing the presence of this child molester because the law did not allow \nfor the release of sex\u2010offender information to the public. The law was changed to \npermit the release of this information to the public. On May 8, 1996, President \nClinton signed the law, dubbed \"Megan's Law,\" in remembrance of Megan Kanka. \nThe Governor signed California's version of Megan's Law into effect on September \n25, 1996. This law was implemented to allow potential victims to protect \nthemselves and to allow parents to protect their children from sexual predators. \nInformation about certain designated persons required to register in California as \nsex offenders is available to students, staff, faculty, and the public by viewing the \nCalifornia Department of Justice\u2019s Internet web site at \nhttp://www.meganslaw.ca.gov/ . There are additional sex offenders in California \nthat are not included on this site, but are known to law enforcement. Detailed \npersonal profile information on individual registrants may be obtained by using a \nsex offender\u2019s specific name, Zip Code, or City/County listings. Additionally, the \nmap application may be used to search individual neighborhoods throughout \nCalifornia to determine the specific location of any of those registrants on whom \nthe law allows the Department of Justice to display a home address. The Internet \nweb site does not list sex offender information specifically by a college or \n16 \nuniversity name or zip code where a sex offender may work, attend, reside, or \nvolunteer.  \nYou may obtain information on sexual offenders living in the area by contacting: \nLivermore Police Department \n1110 S. Livermore Avenue  \nLivermore, CA 94550 \nPhone: (925) 371\u20104900 \nAccess to Buildings \nThe college\u2019s normal hours of operation are printed on signs at every entrance to \nthe campus. They are: 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Monday through Friday and 7:00 \na.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Saturday. There are special events that typically take place \nafter the normal hours of operation, however, access is restricted to the special \nevent(s). Individuals who need to be in campus buildings or areas outside the \nnormal hours of operation must obtain authorization from their supervisor and \nmust notify the on\u2010duty campus safety officer of their presence. All students, \nfaculty and staff have been issued ID cards which they may be asked to produce if \nthere is a question about their authorization to be in a specific area before, \nduring, or after the normal hours of operation. \nMany college buildings, classrooms and labs are protected by intrusion alarms. Do \nnot enter the area until an instructor or authorized person has deactivated the \nalarm. We are all responsible to ensure the safety and security of our college \nbuildings and facilities. Ensure all doors and windows are locked when rooms are \nunattended. Turn off lights, gas, machinery, or equipment when not in use. \nActivate the intrusion alarm system if applicable. Report any problems with safety \nor security of our buildings, facilities, or areas promptly to the Campus Safety and \nSecurity office. \nHate Crimes \nHate Crimes\u2010consist of any act of intimidation, harassment, physical force or \nthreat of physical force directed against any person, group, family, community \n17 \norganization or property motivated in whole or in part by hostility toward real or \nperceived race, ethnic background, national origin, religious belief, gender, age, \ndisability, sexual orientation or political affiliation with the intent of causing fear, \ninjury, intimidation or to deter the free exercise and enjoyment of any right \nsecured by the Constitution or law. Las Positas College does not condone hate \nviolence and is charged with ensuring that the rights guaranteed by state law and \nthe United States Constitution are safeguarded. \nWhenever a member of the campus is a victim or receives a report of a suspected \nhate crime or other activity which reasonably appears to involve a potential hate \ncrime it should be immediately reported to the Campus Safety Department or \nCampus Security Authority \nPreventing and Responding to Sexual Violence \nIt is the policy of Las Positas College to provide a campus environment in which \nindividuals can interact freely without fear of experiencing sexual assault. The \ncollege recognizes that awareness is the best tool for avoidance of sexual assault. \nStudent and employee orientations, announcements, staff meetings, classroom \ndiscussions, and other means will be utilized periodically to inform students and \nstaff of this issue. Las Positas College does not discriminate on the basis of sex, \ngender, including gender identity or expression, or sexual orientation in its \neducation programs or activities. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, \nand certain other federal and state laws, prohibit discrimination on the basis of \nsex, gender, or sexual orientation in employment, as well as all education \nprograms and activities operated by the Las Positas College, and protect all \npeople regardless of their gender from sex discrimination, including sexual \nharassment, sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, dating or domestic \nviolence, and stalking. \nLas Positas College seeks to provide an education environment in which students, \nfaculty, and staff work together in an atmosphere free of sexual misconduct, \nincluding sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence \nand stalking. Every member of the college community shall be aware that sexual \nmisconduct, and/or acts of violence with a sexual nature directed toward another \nperson will not be tolerated and are prohibited by federal and state law and Las \nPositas College policy. As members of the Las Positas College community, student \n18 \nshall comply with college policies and guidelines in addition to federal, state, and \nlocal laws whether on or off campus. Las Positas College will discipline persons \nidentified as responsible for sexual misconduct dating or domestic violence, or \nstalking as described in this report and Las Positas College policy. In an ongoing \neffort to prevent sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence and \nstalking, the Las Positas College Campus Safety provides education and \nprevention programs, investigates complaints, dispenses corrective or disciplinary \naction where appropriate, provides referrals for medical care/counseling, \nmodified classes, reduced course loads, campus housing changes, work \nassignment assistance, stay away orders, leaves of absence, and more. Campus \nSafety also provides information to victims on pursuing criminal action and \nobtaining protective orders if needed.  \nLas Positas College is committed to empowering victims of sexual misconduct, \ndating violence, domestic violence, and stalking by providing ample supportive \nservices and encouraging their choice of action, regardless of their decision to \nseek criminal prosecution of offender(s). If requested by the victim, Las Positas \nCollege personnel will assist the victim in notifying the appropriate law \nenforcement authorities.  \nReporting Options \nVictims have several reporting options including those with confidentiality, and \nmay pursue one or all of these options at any time. Victims have a right to have a \nfriend, family member, sexual assault victim advocate, or other representative \npresent while reporting the incident. They also have the right to have a sexual \nassault victim advocate and support person of their choice present with them \nduring a rape examination. The campus Title IX coordinator can assist in notifying \nthe police. Victims may also take any of the actions below. \nCriminal \nReporting to the Las Positas College Campus Safety Department and/or local \npolice is an option at any time. Victims who choose not to report to the police \nimmediately following a sexual misconduct, dating and domestic violence, or \n19 \nstalking incident, can still make the report at a later time. However, with the \npassage of time, the ability to gather evidence to assist with criminal prosecution \nmay be limited. Depending on the circumstances, the police may be able to obtain \na criminal restraining order on the victim\u2019s behalf. \nReporting to a CSA \nAny member of the college community may report incidents of sexual \nmisconduct, dating violence, domestic violence or stalking to any campus security \nauthority (CSAs). The CSA will assist the victim in notifying the appropriate law \nenforcement agency if the victim requests the assistance of law enforcement. In \naddition, most campus employees including CSAs are required to report incidents \nof sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence and stalking to the Title \nIX coordinator. Title IX coordinator\u2019s reporting responsibilities are described in \ndetail below. \nNote: if Campus Safety determines that the perpetrator poses a serious and \nimmediate threat to the campus community, under the Clery Act the campus may \nbe required to issue a timely warning to the community. Any such warning will \nnot include any information that identifies the victim. \nThe Importance of Preserving Evidence \nIn cases of Sexual Misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the \npreservation of physical evidence is important to facilitate the identity and \nsuccessful prosecution of the offender. The victim should not change clothes, \nbathe, douche, or shower following the attack. Sexual Assault Response Team \n(SART) medical personnel are trained to collect, process, and preserve physical \nevidence of Sexual Misconduct, and are committed in their assistance to the \nvictim. Victims may request a SART exam to preserve forensic evidence without \ncompleting a police report. This evidence may be used in the case a victim wishes \nto report the assault at a later date. Victims are not financially responsible for \nSART exams and the cost will be the responsibility of the local law enforcement \njurisdiction. \nAs time passes, evidence may dissipate or become lost or unavailable, thereby \nmaking investigation, possible prosecution, disciplinary proceedings, or obtaining \nprotection orders related to the incident more difficult. Victims who choose not \n20 \nto make a complaint regarding an incident, nevertheless should consider speaking \nwith the Campus Safety Department or other law enforcement to preserve \nevidence in the event that they change their mind and wishes to report the \nassault at a later date. \nDefinition of Terms  \nSex Discrimination is an adverse action taken against an individual because of \ngender or sex (including sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, domestic \nviolence, dating violence, and stalking) as prohibited by Title IX; Title IV; \nVAWA/Campus SAVE Act California Education Code \u00a7 66250 et seq: California \nEducation Code 11135. See also Title VII of the civil rights act of 1964, the \nCalifornia Fair Employment and Housing Act (Cal. Govt. Code 12940 et seq.), and \nother applicable laws. Persons of all genders and gender identities can be victims \nof sex discrimination. \nSexual Harassment is a form of sex discrimination, unwelcome verbal, nonverbal \nor physical conduct of a sexual nature that includes, but is not limited to sexual \nadvances, requests for sexual favors, offering benefits or giving preferential \ntreatment in exchange for sexual favors and any other conduct of a sexual nature \nwhere: \n\u2022 submission to, or rejection of, the conduct is explicitly or implicitly used as the \nbasis for any decision affecting a person\u2019s employment terms or conditions, \nacademic status or progress, or access to benefits and services, honors, \nprograms; or \n\u2022 b. the conduct is sufficiently severe, persistent or pervasive that its effect, \nwhether or not intended, could be considered by a reasonable person in the \nshoes of the complainant, and is in fact considered by the complainant, as \nlimiting their ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities or \nopportunities offered by the college; or \n\u2022 c. The conduct is sufficiently severe, persistent or pervasive that its effect, \nwhether or not intended, could be considered by a reasonable person in the \nshoes of the complainant, and is in fact considered by the complainant, as \ncreating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment. \n21 \nSexual harassment could include being forced to engage in unwanted sexual \ncontact as a condition of membership in a student organization; being subjected \nto a video exploitation or campaign of sexually explicit graffiti; or frequently being \nexposed to unwanted images of a sexual nature in the classroom or work \nenvironment that are unrelated to the coursework or employment. \nSexual harassment also includes acts of verbal, nonverbal or physical aggression, \nintimidation or hostility based on gender or sex\u2010stereotyping, even if those acts \ndo not involve conduct of a sexual nature. \nThe college\u2019s policy covers unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. While \nromantic, sexual, intimate, personal or social relationships between members of \nthe college community may begin as consensual, they may evolve into situations \nthat lead to sexual harassment or sexual misconduct, including dating or domestic \nviolence, or stalking, subject to the college policy. \nSexual Misconduct: All sexual activity between members of the Las Positas \nCollege community must be based on affirmative consent. Engaging in any sexual \nactivity without first obtaining affirmative consent to the specific activity is sexual \nmisconduct, whether or not the conduct violates any civil or criminal law. Sexual \nactivity includes, but is not limited to, kissing or touching intimate body parts, \nfondling, intercourse, penetration of any body part, and oral sex. It also includes \nany unwelcome physical sexual acts, such as unwelcome sexual touching, sexual \nassault, sexual battery, rape, and dating violence. When based on gender, \ndomestic violence or stalking also constitutes sexual misconduct. Sexual \nmisconduct may include using physical force, violence threat, or intimidation, \nignoring the objections of the other person, causing the other person\u2019s \nintoxication or incapacitation through the use of drugs or alcohol, or taking \nadvantage of the other person\u2019s incapacitation (including voluntary intoxication) \nto engage in sexual activity. Persons of all genders can be victims of these forms \nof sexual misconduct. Sexual activity with a minor is never consensual when the \ncomplainant is under 18 years old, because the minor is considered incapable of \ngiving legal consent due to age. \nSexual Violence is a form of sexual harassment and means physical sexual acts, \nsuch as unwelcome sexual touching, sexual assault, sexual battery, rape, domestic \nviolence, dating violence, and stalking (when based on gender or sex), \nperpetrated against an individual against his or her will and without consent or \n22 \nagainst an individual who is incapable of giving consent due to that individual's \nuse of drugs or alcohol, status as a minor or disability. Sexual violence may include \nphysical force, violence, threat, or intimidation, ignoring the objections of the \nother person, causing the other person\u2019s intoxication or incapacitation through \nthe use of drugs or alcohol, or taking advantage of the other person\u2019s \nincapacitation (including voluntary intoxication). \nMen as well as women can be victims of these forms of sexual violence. Unlawful \nsexual intercourse with a minor (statutory rape) occurs even if the intercourse is \nconsensual when the victim is under 18 years old, because the victim is \nconsidered incapable of giving legal consent due to age. \nSexual Assault is a form of sexual misconduct, an attempt, coupled with the \nability, to commit a violent injury on the person of another because of that \nperson\u2019s gender or sex. \nSexual Battery is a form of sexual misconduct and is defined as any willful or \nunlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another because of that \nperson\u2019s gender or sex, as well as touching an intimate part of another person \nagainst that person\u2019s will and for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification or \nabuse. \nRape is a form of sexual misconduct, nonconsensual sexual intercourse that may \nalso involve the use of threat of force, violence, or immediate and unlawful bodily \ninjury or threats of future retaliation and duress. Any sexual penetration, however \nslight, is sufficient to constitute rape. Sexual acts including intercourse are \nconsidered non\u2010consensual when a person is incapable of giving consent because \nthey are incapacitated from alcohol and/or drugs, are under 18 years old, or if a \nmental disorder or developmental or physical disability renders a person \nincapable of giving consent. The respondents\u2019 relationship to the person (such as \na family member, spouse, friend, acquaintance or stranger) is irrelevant. (See \ncomplete definition of Consent below.) \nAcquaintance Rape is a form of sexual misconduct committed by an individual \nknown to the victim. This includes a person the victim may have just met or: i.e., \nat a party, introduced through a friend, or a social networking website. \nStatutory Rape is non\u2010forcible sexual intercourse with a person who is under \nstatutory age of consent. (18 years old in California.) \n23 \nAffirmative Consent is an informed, affirmative, conscious, voluntary, and mutual \nagreement to engage in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person \ninvolved in the sexual activity to ensure affirmative consent has been obtained \nfrom the other participant(s) to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or \nresistance does not mean affirmative consent, nor does silence mean consent. \nAffirmative consent must be voluntary, and given without coercion, force, threats, \nor intimidation. \n\u2022 The existence of a dating or social relationship between those involved, or \nthe fact of past sexual activities between them, should never by itself be \nassumed to be an indicator of affirmative consent. A request for someone \nto use a condom or birth control does not, in and of itself, constitute \naffirmative consent. \n\u2022 Affirmative consent can be withdrawn or revoked. Consent to one form of \nsexual activity (or one sexual act) does not constitute consent to other \nforms of sexual activity. Consent given to sexual activity on one occasion \ndoes not constitute consent on another occasion. There must always be \nmutual and affirmative consent to engage in sexual activity. Consent must \nbe ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time, \nincluding after penetration. Once consent is withdrawn or revoked, the \nsexual activity must stop immediately. \n\u2022 Affirmative consent cannot be given by a person who is incapacitated. A \nperson is unable to consent when asleep, unconscious or is incapacitated \ndue to the influence of drugs, alcohol or medication so that the person \ncould not understand the fact, nature or extent of the sexual activity. A \nperson is incapacitated if they lack the physical and/or mental ability to \nmake informed, rational decisions. \n\u2022 Whether an intoxicated person (as a result of using alcohol or other drugs) \nis incapacitated depends on the extent to which the alcohol or other drugs \nimpact the person\u2019s decision\u2010making ability, awareness of consequences, \nand ability to make informed judgments. A person\u2019s own intoxication or \nincapacitation from drugs or alcohol does not diminish that person\u2019s \n24 \nresponsibility to obtain affirmative consent before engaging in sexual \nactivity. \n\u2022 A person with a medical or mental disability may also lack the capacity to \ngive consent. \n\u2022 Sexual activity with a minor (a person under 18 years old those parentheses \nis not consensual, because a minor is considered incapable of giving \nconsent due to age. \n\u2022 It shall not be a valid excuse that a person affirmatively consented to the \nsexual activity if the respondent knew or reasonably should have known \nthat the person was unable to consent to the sexual activity under any of \nthe following circumstances \n\u2022 The person was asleep or unconscious \n\u2022 The person was incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol or \nmedication, so that the person could not understand the fact, nature or \nextent of the sexual activity; \n\u2022 The person was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical \ncondition. \n\u2022 It shall not be a valid excuse that the respondent believed that the person \nconsented to the sexual activity under either of the following \ncircumstances: \n\u2022 the respondents believe an affirmative consent arose from the intoxication \nor recklessness of the respondent; \n\u2022 The respondent did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known \nto the \nRespondent at the time, to ascertain whether the person affirmatively consented. \nDomestic violence is abuse committed against someone who is a current or \nformer spouse; current or former cohabitant; someone with whom the abuser \nhas a child; someone with whom the abuser has or had a dating or engagement \nrelationship; or a person similarly situated under the California domestic or family \nviolence law. Cohabitant means to unrelated persons living together for a \n25 \nsubstantial period of time, resulting in some permanency of relationship. Factors \nthat may determine whether persons are cohabitating include, that are not \nlimited to, (1) sexual relations between the parties while sharing the same living \nquarters, (2) sharing of income expenses, (3) joint use or ownership of property, \n(4) whether the parties hold themselves out as husband and wife, (5) the \ncontinuity of the relationship, \nand/or (6) the length of the relationship. For purposes of this definition, \u201cabuse\u201d \nmeans intentionally or recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury or \nplacing another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily \ninjury to themselves or others. Abuse does not include nonphysical, emotional \ndistress or injury. \nDating violence is abuse committed by a person who is or has been in a social \ndating relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim. This may \ninclude someone the victim just met; i.e. at a party, introduced through a friend, \nor on a social networking website. For the purposes of this definition, \u201cabuse\u201d \nmeans intentionally or recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury or \nplacing another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily \ninjury to themselves or others. Abuse does not include nonphysical, emotional \ndistress or injury. \nStalking is defined as engaging in a repeated course of conduct directed at a \nspecific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their own or \nothers safety, or to suffer substantial emotional distress. For purposes of this \ndefinition: \n\u2022 Course of conduct means two or more acts, including but not limited to, \nacts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any \naction, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveys, \nthreatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a \nperson\u2019s property; \n\u2022  Reasonable person means a reasonable person under similar \ncircumstances and with the same protected status(es) as the complainant; \n\u2022 Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or \nanguish that may, but does not necessarily require medical or other \nprofessional treatment or counseling. \n26 \n\u2022 Protected status includes age, disability, gender, genetic information, \ngender identity or expression, nationality, marital status, race or ethnicity, \nreligion, sexual orientation, and veteran or military status. \nProcedures for Reporting a Crime of Sexual Violence and/or Sexual \nMisconduct \nCall 9\u20101\u20101 in any kind of emergency, or when facing immediate harm or threat of \nharm. \nPersons who have experienced sexual misconduct, including rape, dating \nviolence, domestic violence, or stalking, are encouraged to seek immediate \nassistance from police and healthcare providers for their physical safety, \nemotional support and medical care. Campus Safety or local police can escort \nvictims to a safe place and transport them to a hospital for medical treatment, if \nneeded. Victims who prefer not to notify the police, are strongly encouraged to \nseek assistance from the campus Title \u2168 Coordinator and/or a Sexual Assault \nVictim Advocate or counselor who can provide information on options, rights and \nremedies. \nVictims have the right to decide who and when to tell about Sexual Misconduct, \nDating and Domestic Violence, and Stalking. However, it is very important that \nthey get medical attention after being assaulted. Following the incident, a victim \nmay be physically injured, may have contracted a sexually transmitted disease, or \nmay become pregnant. \nLas Positas College primary concern is the safety and well\u2010being of every member \nof the campus community. The use of alcohol or drugs never makes the victim at \nfault. If a campus community member has experienced Sexual Misconduct, Dating \nViolence, Domestic Violence, or Stalking they should not be deterred from \nreporting the incident out of a concern that they might be disciplined for related \nviolations of drug, alcohol, or other Las Positas College policies. Except in extreme \ncircumstances, college students or employees who are victims of Sexual \nMisconduct, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, or Stalking will not be subject to \ndiscipline. The college encourages victims of Sexual Misconduct, Dating Violence, \nDomestic Violence, or Stalking to talk to someone about what happened \u2013 so they \ncan get the support they need, and so the college can respond appropriately. \nWhether \u2013 and the extent to which \u2013 a college employee may agree to maintain \nconfidentiality (and not disclose information to the Title \u2168 Coordinator) depends \n27 \non the employee\u2019s position and responsibilities at the college. The following \ninformation is intended to make everyone aware of the various reporting and \nconfidential disclosure options available to them \u2013 so they can make informed \nchoices about where to turn for help. Las Positas College strongly encourages \nvictims to talk to someone identified in one or more of these groups. \nCertain college employees, listed below, are required by law to maintain near or \ncomplete confidentiality; talking to them is sometimes called a \u201cprivileged \ncommunication.\u201d Las Positas College Campus Safety officers may maintain the \nvictim\u2019s identity as confidential, if requested by the victim, but will report the \nfacts of the incident to the Title \u2168 Coordinator, including the identity of the \nperpetrator. Most other college employees are required to report all details of an \nincident (including the identities of both the victim and alleged perpetrator) to \nthe Title \u2168 Coordinator so the college can take immediate action to protect the \nvictim, and take steps to correct and eliminate the misconduct. \nC\nampus Safety, the Title \u2168 Coordinator, college\u2010e\nmployed physicians, \nprofessional counselors, licensed clinical social workers, sexual assault and \ndomestic violence counselors and advocates, and certain other college employees \nare required to explain to victims their rights and options with respect to \nconfidentiality. \nVoluntary Confidential Reporting \nPursuant to California education code section 67380(a)(6)(A), CSAs who receive \nreports from employees or students of a Part 1 violent crime, sexual assault or \nhate crime that occurred in either a campus or non\u2010campus location as defined by \nthe Clery Act, may not disclose to the Campus Safety department or local law \nenforcement agencies the names of the victims or the alleged assailant, unless \nthe victim consents to disclosing their name after being informed of the right to \nhave personally identifying information withheld. The name of the alleged \nassailant may be disclosed, however, if all of the following conditions are met: \n\u2022 The alleged assailant represents a serious or ongoing threat to the safety of \nthe students, employees, or the institution; and \n\u2022 The immediate assistance of the local law enforcement agency is necessary \nto contact detain the alleged assailant. \n28 \nPrivileged and Confidential Communications \nTreating physicians, psychotherapists, professional counselors, and clergy who \nwork or volunteer providing medical or mental health treatment or counseling \n(including those who act in that role under their supervision may not report any \ninformation about an incident of Sexual Misconduct, Dating Violence, Domestic \nViolence, or Stalking to anyone else at the college, including the Title \u2168 \nCoordinator, without the victim\u2019s consent. A victim can seek assistance and \nsupport from physicians, psychotherapists, professional, licensed counselors, and \nclergy without triggering a college investigation that could reveal the victim\u2019s \nidentity or the fact of the victim\u2019s disclosure. However, see limited exceptions \nbelow regarding when these professionals must report to local law enforcement \nagencies. These confidential professionals should explain these limited exceptions \nto victims, if applicable. \nLas Positas College will be unable to conduct an investigation into a particular \nincident or pursue disciplinary action against a perpetrator if a victim chooses to \n(1) speak only to a treating physician, psychotherapist, professional counselor, or \nclergy member, and (2) maintain complete confidentiality. Even so, these \nindividuals will assist victims in receiving other necessary protection and support, \nsuch as victim advocacy, disability, medical/health or mental health services, or \nlegal services, and will advise victims regarding their right to file a Title IX \ncomplaint with the college and a separate complaint with local police. If a victim \ninsists on confidentiality, the college will likely not be able to fully assist the victim \nwith: college academic support or accommodations; changes to course schedules.  \nA victim who at first requests confidentiality may later decide to file a complaint \nwith the college or report the incident to the police, and thus have the incident \nfully investigated. Counselors and advocates can provide victims with that \nassistance if requested. Treating physicians, psychotherapists, professional \ncounselors, and clergy will also explain that Title IX includes protections against \nretaliation, and that the college will not only take steps to prevent retaliation \nwhen it knows or reasonably should know of possible retaliation, but will also \ntake strong responsive action if it occurs. \nEXCEPTIONS: Under California law, any health practitioner employed in a health \nfacility, clinic, physician\u2019s office, or local or state public health department or \nclinic is required to make a report to local law enforcement if they provide \nmedical services for a physical condition to a patient/victim who they know or \n29 \nreasonably suspect is suffering from (1) a wound or physical injury inflicted by a \nfirearm; or (2) any wound or other physical injury inflicted upon a victim where \nthe injury is the result of assaultive or abusive conduct (including sexual \nmisconduct, domestic violence, and dating violence). This exception does not \napply to sexual assault and domestic violence counselors and advocates. \nHealthcare practitioners should explain this limited exception to victims, if \napplicable. \nAdditionally under California law, physicians, psychotherapist, professional \ncounselors, licensed clinical social workers, clergy, and sexual assault and \ndomestic violence counselors and advocates are mandatory child\u2010abuse and \nneglect reporters, and are required to report incidents involving victims under 18 \nyears of age to local law enforcement. These professionals will explain this limited \nexception to victims, if applicable. Finally some or all of these professionals may \nalso have reporting obligations under California law to (1) report to local law \nenforcement in cases involving threats of immediate or eminent harm to self or \nothers where disclosure of the information is necessary to prevent the threatened \ndanger;(2) to the court if compelled by court order or subpoena in a criminal \nproceeding related to the sexual violence incident. If applicable, these \nprofessionals will explain these limited exceptions to the victims. \nReporting the Local Police \nAs soon after the incident as possible, victims of Sexual Misconduct, Dating \nViolence, Domestic Violence, or Stalking are strongly encouraged to report the \nincident to the police. Sexual Misconduct, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, or \nStalking may be reported to the Hayward and San Leandro Police Departments by \ndialing 911. The Campus Safety Department will support all victims of Sexual \nMisconduct, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, or Stalking regardless of their \ndecision to seek criminal prosecution of the offender or not. Victims have the \noption to report anonymously to the police and the decision to seek criminal \nprosecution remains with the victim. Las Positas College, Campus Safety \nDepartment will protect the confidentiality of the victim to the extent permitted \nby applicable California State law. \nIf a victim reports to a local police agency about sexual misconduct, dating \nviolence, domestic violence, or stalking, the police are required to notify victims \nthat their names will become a matter of public record unless confidentiality is \nrequested. If a victim requests that their identity be kept confidential, their name \n30 \nwill not become a matter of public record and the police will not report the \nvictim\u2019s identity to anyone else at the college, including the Title IX Coordinator. \nCampus Safety will, however, report the facts of the incident itself, including the \nidentity of the perpetrator if known, to the Title \u2168 Coordinator being sure not to \nreveal the victim names/identities or compromise their own criminal \ninvestigation. The Campus Safety Department is required by the federal Clery Act \nto report certain types of crimes (including certain sex offenses) in statistical \nreports. However, while the Campus Safety Department will report the type of \nincident in the annual crime statistics report known as the Annual Security \nReport, victim names/identities will not be revealed. \nIn cases of Sexual Misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the \npreservation of physical evidence is important to facilitate the identity and \nsuccessful prosecution of the offender. The victim should not change clothes, \nbathe, douche, or shower following the attack. Sexual Assault Response Team \n(SART) medical personnel are trained to collect, process, and preserve physical \nevidence of Sexual Misconduct, and are committed in their assistance to the \nvictim. Victims may request a SART exam to preserve forensic evidence without \ncompleting a police report. This evidence may be used in the case a victim wishes \nto report the assault at a later date. Victims are not financially responsible for \nSART exams and the cost will be the responsibility of the local law enforcement \njurisdiction. \nAs time passes, evidence may dissipate or become lost or unavailable, thereby \nmaking investigation, possible prosecution, disciplinary proceedings, or obtaining \nprotection orders related to the incident more difficult. Victims who choose not \nto make a complaint regarding an incident, nevertheless should consider speaking \nwith the Campus Safety Department or other law enforcement to preserve \nevidence in the event that they change their mind and wish to report the assault \nat a later date. \nA victim has the right to have a confidential advocate present when reporting to \nlaw enforcement and during examinations. With the victim\u2019s consent, the \nconfidential advocate will assess the victim\u2019s immediate needs and provide \nsupport and referral as appropriate. This confidential assistance may include: \ncounseling, information concerning rape trauma syndrome; information on the \ncollection of medical evidence and available health services to test for injuries, \nsexually transmitted diseases, and/or pregnancy. Assistance is also available with \naccess to other resources and services, including assistance in obtaining \n31 \nemergency protection orders and restraining orders. \nAdministrative Reporting \nVictims may report to the campus Title IX Coordinator, who will provide written \nand verbal information regarding applicable college complaint procedures for \ninvestigating and addressing the incident. \nThe Title IX Coordinator will also provide information regarding resources \navailable to victims, as well as information regarding their rights and options. \nContact information for the Title IX Coordinator is listed above. \nReporting to a Title IX Coordinator or Responsible Employee \nMany resources and options are available on and off campus including \nconfidential and privileged communication options. Las Positas College has \ndesignated a Title \u2168 Coordinator as the primary point of contact to provide \nvictims with assistance and support, and to monitor and oversee overall \ncompliance with laws and policies related to sexual misconduct, dating violence, \ndomestic violence, or stalking. The campus Title \u2168 Coordinator is available to \nexplain and discuss rights to file a criminal complaint and to assist in doing so; the \ncollege\u2019s relevant complaint process, and rights to receive assistance with that \nprocess, including the investigation process; how confidentiality is handled; \navailable resources, both on and off campus; and other related matters. \nM\nost college employees have a duty to report Sexual Misconduct, Dating \nViolence, Domestic Violence, or Stalking incidents when they are on notice of it. \nWhen a victim tells the Title \u2168 Coordinator or another non\u2010c\nonfidential college \nemployee about a sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, or \nstalking incident, the victim has the right to expect the college to take immediate \nand appropriate steps to investigate what happened and to resolve the matter \npromptly and equitably. In all cases, the college strongly encourages victims to \nreport sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking directly \nto the campus Title \u2168 Coordinator. \nAs detailed above, most college employees except treating physicians, licensed \ncounselors, and clergy must report to the Title \u2168 Coordinator all relevant details \nabout any sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking \nincidents of which they become aware. The college will need to determine what \n32 \nhappened and will need to know the names of the victim(s) and the \nperpetrator(s), any witnesses, and any other relevant facts, including the date, \ntime and specific location of the incident.  \nTo the extent possible, information reported to the Title IX Coordinator or other \ncollege employees will be kept private and shared only with individuals \nresponsible for handling the college\u2019s response to the incident. The college will \nprotect the privacy of individuals involved in a sexual misconduct, dating violence, \ndomestic violence, or stalking incident except as otherwise required by law or \ncollege policy. A sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking \nreport may result in the gathering of extremely sensitive information about \nindividuals in the campus community. While such information is considered \nconfidential, college policy regarding access to public records and disclosure of \npersonal information may require disclosure of certain information concerning a \nreport. In such cases, efforts will be made to redact the records, as appropriate, in \norder to protect the victim\u2019s identity and privacy and the privacy of other involved \nindividuals. Except as detailed in the section titled \"Privileged and Confidential \nReports\" above, no college employee, including the Title \u2168 Coordinator, should \ndisclose the victim\u2019s identity to the police without the victim\u2019s consent or unless \nthe victim has also reported the incident to the police. \nI\nf a victim requests of the Title \u2168 Coordinator or another college employee that \ntheir identity remain completely confidential, the Title \u2168 Coordinator will explain \nthat the college cannot always honor that request and guarantee complete \nconfidentiality. If a victim wishes to remain confidential or request that no \ninvestigation be conducted or disciplinary action taken, the college must weigh \nthat request against the college\u2019s obligation to provide a safe, non\u2010d\niscriminatory \nenvironment for all students, employees and third parties, including the victim. \nUnder those circumstances, the Title \u2168 Coordinator will determine whether the \nvictim\u2019s request for complete confidentiality and/or no investigation can be \nhonored under the facts and circumstances of the particular case, including \nwhether the college has a legal obligation to report the incident, conduct an \ninvestigation or take other appropriate steps. Without information about a \nvictim\u2019s identity, the college ability to meaningfully investigate the incident and \npursue disciplinary action against the perpetrator may be severely limited. \nThe Title \u2168 Coordinator will inform the victim of the initiation of an investigation \nprior to starting an investigation and will, to the extent possible, only share \ninformation with people responsible for handling the college response to the \n33 \nincident. The Title \u2168 Coordinator will remain mindful of the victim\u2019s well\u2010being, \nand will take ongoing steps to protect the victim from retaliation or harm, and \nwork with the victim to create a safety plan. Retaliation against the victim, \nwhether by students, employees or third parties, will not be tolerated. The \ncollege and Title \u2168 Coordinator will also: \n\u2022 Provide interim remedies requested by the victim, if they are reasonably \navailable, regardless of whether the victim chooses to report to campus or \nlocal police; \n\u2022 Assist victims in accessing available victim advocacy, academic support, \ncounseling, disability, medical/health or mental health services, and legal \nassistance both on and off campus; \n\u2022 Provide security and support, which could include issuing a no\u2010contact \norder, helping arrange a change of campus\u2010based living or working \narrangements or course schedules (including for the perpetrator pending \nthe outcome of the investigation) or adjustments for assignments, tests, or \nwork duties; and \n\u2022 Inform victims of their right to report a crime to local police \u2013 and provide \nvictims with assistance if desired. \nThe college will not require a victim to participate in any investigation or \ndisciplinary proceeding if the victim does not wish to participate. \nThe college will not generally notify parents or legal guardians of a sexual \nmisconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking report unless the \nvictim is under 18 years old or the victim provides the college with written \npermission to do so. \nUnder California law, and pursuant to college policy, many college employees, \nincluding the Title \u2168 Coordinator, are mandatory child abuse and neglect \nreporters and should explain to victims under 18 years of age that they are \nrequired to report the incident to the police. However, the identity of the person \nwho reports and the report itself are confidential and disclosed only among \nappropriate agencies. \nBecause the college is under a continuing legal obligation to address the issue of \nsexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking campus\u2010wide, \nreports (including non\u2010identifying reports) may also require the college to \nconsider broader remedial action \u2013 such as increased monitoring, supervision or \n34 \nsecurity at locations where the reported incident(s) occurred; increased \neducation, training and prevention efforts, including to targeted population \ngroups; climate assessments/victimization surveys; and/or revision of policies and \npractices. \nWhat is Title IX  \nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681) is an all \u2010\nencompassing federal law that prohibits discrimination based on the gender of \nstudents and employees of educational institutions which receive federal \nfinancial assistance.  \n\"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance...\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 \nUnder Title IX, discrimination on the basis of sex can include sexual harassment, \nrape, and sexual assault. A college or university that receives federal funds may \nbe held legally responsible when it knows about and ignores sexual harassment \nor assault in its programs or activities. The university can be held responsible in \ncourt whether the harassment is committed by a faculty member, staff or \nstudent. \nThis Policy is designed to address conduct that falls within Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments of 1972 and other federal and state laws and \nregulations. This Policy addresses misconduct occurring on or after August 14, \n2020. \nHistoric Recognition of Sexual Harassment as Sex Discrimination  \nThe U.S. Department of Education Title IX regulations recognize that sexual \nharassment, including sexual assault, is unlawful sex discrimination. The U.S. \nDepartment of Education previously addressed sexual harassment only through \nguidance documents, which  are not legally binding and do not have the force \nand effect of law. The U.S. Department of Education\u2019s regulations impose \nimportant legal obligations on school districts, colleges, and universities \n(collectively \u201cschools\u201d), requiring a prompt response to  reports of sexual \n35 \nharassment. The Final Rule improves the clarity and transparency of the \nrequirements for how schools must respond to sexual harassment under Title IX \nso that every complainant receives appropriate support, respondents are \ntreated as responsible only after receiving due process and fundamental \nfairness, and school officials serve impartially without bias for or against any \nparty. \nSupporting Complainants & Respecting Complainants\u2019 Autonomy  \nSchools must offer free supportive measures to every alleged victim of sexual \nharassment (called \u201ccomplainants\u201d). Supportive measures are individualized \nservices to restore or preserve equal access to education, protect student and \nemployee safety, or dete r sexual harassment. Supportive measures must be \noffered even if a complainant does not wish to initiate or participate in a \ngrievance process. Every situation is unique, and individuals react to sexual \nharassment differently. Therefore, the Final Rule giv es complainants control \nover the school \u2010l evel response best meeting their needs. It respects \ncomplainants\u2019 wishes and autonomy by giving them the clear choice to file a \nformal complaint, separate from the right to supportive measures. The Final \nRule also p rovides a fair and impartial grievance process for complainants, and \nprotects complainants from being coerced or threatened into participating in a \ngrievance process.  \nNon-Discrimination, Free Speech, and Due Process  \nThe Final Rule reflects core American values of equal treatment on the basis of \nsex, free speech and academic freedom, due process of law, and fundamental \nfairness. Schools must operate free from sex discrimination, including sexual \nharassment. Complainant s and respondents must have strong, clear procedural \nrights in a predictable, transparent grievance process designed to reach reliable \noutcomes. The Final Rule ensures that schools do not violate First Amendment \nrights when complying with Title IX.  \n36 \nResponse to Sexual Harassment  \nUnder the Final Rule, any of the following conduct on the basis of sex \nconstitutes sexual harassment:  \n1. A school employee conditioning an educational benefit or service upon a \nperson\u2019s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct (often called \u201cquid \npro quo\u201d harassment);  \n2. Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, \npervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person \nequal access to the school\u2019s education program or activity; or  \n3. Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking (as those \noffenses are defined in the Clery Act, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1092(f), and the \nViolence Against Women Act, 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 12291(a)).  \nConsistent with U.S. Supreme Court precedent and the text of Title IX, a school \nmust respond when: (1) the school has actual knowledge of sexual harassment; \n(2) that occurred within the school\u2019s education program or activity; (3) against a \nperson in the Un ited States. The Final Rule expands \u201cactual knowledge\u201d to \ninclude notice to any elementary or secondary school employee, and states that \nany person (e.g., the alleged victim or any third party) may report to a Title IX \nCoordinator in person or by e \u2010m ail, phone, or mail. The Final Rule also specifies \nthat a school\u2019s \u201ceducation program or activity\u201d includes situations over which \nthe school exercised substantial control, and also buildings owned or controlled \nby student organizations officially recognized by a  postsecondary institution.  \nConsistent with U.S. Supreme Court precedent, a school violates Title IX when \nits response to sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of the known \ncircumstances, and the Final Rule adds mandatory response obligations such as \noffering supportive measures to every complainant, with or without a formal \ncomplaint. \nSchools must investigate every formal complaint (which may be filed by a \ncomplainant or by a school\u2019s Title IX Coordinator). If the alleged conduct does \nnot fall under Title IX, then a school may address the allegations under the \nschool\u2019s own code of conduct and provide supportive measures.  \n37 \nFair Grievance Process  \nThe Final Rule requires schools to investigate and adjudicate formal complaints \nof sexual harassment using a grievance process that incorporates due process \nprinciples, treats all parties fairly, and reaches reliable responsibility \ndeterminations. A school\u2019s grievance process must:  \n1. Give both parties written notice of the allegations, an equal opportunity \nto select an advisor of the party\u2019s choice (who may be, but does not need \nto be, an attorney), and an equal opportunity to submit and review \nevidence throughout the investigation;  \n2. Use trained Title IX personnel to objectively evaluate all relevant \nevidence without prejudgment of the facts at issue and free from \nconflicts of interest or bias for or against either party;  \n3. Protect parties\u2019 privacy by requiring a party\u2019s written consent before \nusing the party\u2019s medical, psychological, or similar treatment records \nduring a grievance process;  \n4. Obtain the parties\u2019 voluntary, written consent before using any kind of \n\u201cinformal resolution\u201d process, such as mediation or restorative justice, \nand not use an informal process where an employee allegedly sexually \nharassed a student;  \n5. Apply a presumption that the respondent is not responsible during the \ngrievance process (often called a \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d), so that \nthe school bears the burden of proof and the standard of evidence is \napplied correctly;  \n6. Use either the preponderance of the evidence standard or the clear and \nconvincing evidence standard (and use the same standard for formal \ncomplaints against students as for formal complaints against employees);  \n7. Ensure the decision \u2010m aker is not the same person as the investigator or \nthe Title IX Coordinator (i.e., no \u201csingle investigator models\u201d);  \n8. For postsecondary institutions, hold a live hearing and allow cross \u2010\nexamination by party advisors(never by the parties personally); K \u20101 2 \nschools do not need to hold a hearing, but parties may submit written \nquestions for the other parties and witnesses to answer;  \n9. Protect all complainants from inappropriately being asked about prior \nsexual history (\u201crape shield\u201d protections);  \n10. Send both parties a written determination regarding responsibility \nexplaining how and why the decision maker reached conclusions;  \n38 \n11. Effectively implement remedies for a complainant if a respondent is \nfound responsible for sexual harassment;  \n12. Offer both parties an equal opportunity to appeal;  \n13. Protect any individual, including complainants, respondents, and \nwitnesses, from retaliation for reporting sexual harassment or \nparticipating (or refusing to participate) in any Title IX grievance process;  \n14. Make all materials used to train Title IX personnel publicly available \non the school\u2019s website or, if the school does not maintain a website, \nmake these materials available upon request for inspection by members \nof the public; and  \n15. Document and keep records of all sexual harassment reports and \ninvestigations.  \nSex Discrimination Regulations  \nRelating to sex discrimination generally, and not only to sexual harassment, the \nfinal regulations:  \n1. Affirm that the U.S. Department of Education may require schools to take \nremedial action for discriminating on the basis of sex or otherwise \nviolating the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Title IX regulations;  \n2. Expressly state that in response to any claim of sex discrimination under \nTitle IX, schools are never required to deprive an individual of rights \nguaranteed under the U.S. Constitution;  \n3. Account for the interplay of Title IX, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964, and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), as well as \nthe legal rights of parents or guardians to act on behalf of individuals with \nrespect to exercising Title IX  rights; and \n4. Update the requirement for schools to designate and identify a Title IX \nCoordinator, disseminate their non \u2010d iscrimination policy and the Title IX \nCoordinator\u2019s contact information to ensure accessible channels for \nreporting sex discrimination (including se xual harassment), and notify \nstudents, employees, parents, and others of how the school will respond \nto reports and complaints of sex discrimination (including sexual \nharassment).  \n39 \nSummary of Major Provisions of the U.S. Department of \nEducation\u2019s Title IX Final Rule  \nThis Policy is designed to address conduct that falls within Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments of 1972 and other federal and state laws and \nregulations. This Policy addresses misconduct occurring on or after August 14, \n2020. \n1. Notice to the School, College, University (\u201cSchools\u201d): Actual Knowledge  \nThe Final Rule requires a K \u20101 2 school to respond whenever any employee \nhas notice of sexual harassment, including allegations of sexual \nharassment.   Many state laws also require all K \u20101 2 employees to be \nmandatory reporters of child abuse.   For postsecondar y institutions, the \nFinal Rule allows the institution to choose whether to have mandatory \nreporting for all employees, or to designate some employees to be \nconfidential resources for college students to discuss sexual harassment \nwithout automatically trigg ering a report to the Title IX office.   For all \nschools, notice to a Title IX Coordinator, or to an official with authority to \ninstitute corrective measures on the recipient's behalf, charges a school \nwith actual knowledge and triggers the school's respons e obligations.  \n2. Definition of Sexual Harassment for Title IX Purposes  \nThe Final Rule defines sexual harassment broadly to include any of three \ntypes of misconduct on the basis of sex, all of which jeopardize the equal \naccess to education that Title IX is designed to protect: Any instance of \nquid pro quo harassment by a schoo l's employee; any unwelcome \nconduct that a reasonable person would find so severe, pervasive, and \nobjectively offensive that it denies a person equal educational access; any \ninstance of sexual assault (as defined in the Clery Act), dating violence, \ndomestic violence, or stalking as defined in the Violence Against Women \nAct (VAWA).  \n\u2022  \no The Final Rule prohibits sex \u2010b ased misconduct in a manner \nconsistent with the First Amendment. Quid pro quo harassment \n40 \nand Clery Act/VAWA offenses are not evaluated for severity, \npervasiveness, offensiveness, or denial of equal educational \naccess, because such misconduct is sufficiently serious to \ndeprive a person of equal access.  \no The Final Rule uses the U.S. Supreme Court 's Davis definition \n(severe and pervasive and objectively offensive conduct, \neffectively denying a person equal educational access) as one of \nthe three categories of sexual harassment, so that where \nunwelcome sex \u2010b ased conduct consists of speech or expressive \nconduct, schools balance Title IX enforcement with respect for \nfree speech and academic freedom.  \no The Final Rule uses the Supreme Court\u2019s Title IX \u2010s pecific \ndefinition rather than the Supreme Court's Title VII workplace \nstandard (severe or pervasive conduct creating a hostile work \nenvironment). First Amendment concerns differ in educational \nenvironments  and workplace environments, and the Title IX \ndefinition provides First Amendment protections appropriate \nfor educational institutions where students are learning, and \nemployees are teaching. Students, teachers, faculty, and others \nshould enjoy free speech  and academic freedom protections, \neven when speech or expression is offensive.  \n3. Sexual Harassment Occurring in a School\u2019s Education Program or \nActivity and in the United States  \nThe Title IX statute applies to persons in the United States with respect to \neducation programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. \nUnder the Final Rule, schools must respond when sexual harassment \noccurs in the school\u2019s education prog ram or activity, against a person in \nthe United States.  \n\u2022 The Title IX statute and existing regulations contain broad \ndefinitions of a school\u2019s \u201cprogram or activity\u201d and the \nDepartment will continue to look to these definitions for the \nscope of a school\u2019s education program or activity. Education \nprogram or activi ty includes locations, events, or circumstances \nover which the school exercised substantial control over both \nthe respondent and the context in which the sexual harassment \noccurred, and also includes any building owned or controlled by \n41 \na student organization that is officially recognized by a \npostsecondary institution.  \no Title IX applies to all of a school\u2019s education programs or \nactivities, whether such programs or activities occur on \u2010c ampus \nor off\u2010c ampus. A school may address sexual harassment \naffecting its students or employees that falls outside Title IX\u2019s \njurisdiction  in any manner the school chooses, including \nproviding supportive measures or pursuing discipline.  \n4. Accessible Reporting to Title IX Coordinator  \nThe Final Rule expands a school\u2019s obligations to ensure its educational \ncommunity knows how to report to the Title IX Coordinator.  \n\u2022  \no The employee designated by a recipient to coordinate its \nefforts to comply with Title IX responsibilities must be referred \nto as the \u201cTitle IX Coordinator.\u201d  \no Instead of notifying only students and employees of the Title IX \nCoordinator\u2019s contact information, the school must also notify \napplicants for admission and employment, parents or legal \nguardians of elementary and secondary school students, and all \nunions, of the name or title, office address, e \u2010m ail address, and \ntelephone number of the Title IX Coordinator.  \no Schools must prominently display on their websites the \nrequired contact information for the Title IX Coordinator.  \no Any person may report sex discrimination, including sexual \nharassment (whether or not the person reporting is the person \nalleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute sex \ndiscrimination or sexual harassment), in person, by mail, by \ntelephone, o r by e\u2010m ail, using the contact information listed for \nthe Title IX Coordinator, or by any other means that results in \nthe Title IX Coordinator receiving the person\u2019s verbal or written \nreport. \no Such a report may be made at any time, including during non \u2010\nbusiness hours, by using the telephone number or e \u2010m ail \naddress, or by mail to the office address, listed for the Title IX \nCoordinator.  \n42 \n5. School\u2019s Mandatory Response Obligations: The Deliberate Indifference \nStandard \nSchools must respond promptly to Title IX sexual harassment in a manner \nthat is not deliberately indifferent, which means a response that is not \nclearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. Schools have \nthe following mandatory response obligat ions: \u2010 S chools must offer \nsupportive measures to the person alleged to be the victim (referred to \nas the \u201ccomplainant\u201d).  \n\u2022  \no The Title IX Coordinator must promptly contact the \ncomplainant confidentially to discuss the availability of \nsupportive measures, consider the complainant\u2019s wishes with \nrespect to supportive measures, inform the complainant of the \navailability of supportiv e measures with or without the filing of \na formal complaint, and explain to the complainant the process \nfor filing a formal complaint.  \no Schools must follow a grievance process that complies with the \nFinal Rule before the imposition of any disciplinary sanctions or \nother actions that are not supportive measures, against a \nrespondent.  \no Schools must not restrict rights protected under the U.S. \nConstitution, including the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, \nand Fourteenth Amendment, when complying with Title IX.  \no The Final Rule requires a school to investigate sexual \nharassment allegations in any formal complaint, which can be \nfiled by a complainant, or signed by a Title IX Coordinator.  \no The Final Rule affirms that a complainant\u2019s wishes with respect \nto whether the school investigates should be respected unless \nthe Title IX Coordinator determines that signing a formal \ncomplaint to initiate an investigation over the wishes of the \ncomplainan t is not clearly unreasonable in light of the known \ncircumstances.  \no If the allegations in a formal complaint do not meet the \ndefinition of sexual harassment in the Final Rule, or did not \noccur in the school\u2019s education program or activity against a \nperson in the United States, the Final Rule clarifies that the \nschool must dismiss such allegations for purposes of Title IX but \n43 \nmay still address the allegations in any manner the school \ndeems appropriate under the school\u2019s own code of conduct.  \nSchool\u2019s Mandatory Response Obligations: Defining Terms  \nWhen responding to sexual harassment (e.g., by offering supportive measures \nto a complainant and refraining from disciplining a respondent without \nfollowing a Title IX grievance process, which includes investigating formal \ncomplaints of sexual harassment), the Final Rule provides clear definitions of \ncomplainan t, respondent, formal complaint, and supportive measures so that \nrecipients, students, and employees clearly understand how a school must \nrespond to sexual harassment incidents in a way that supports the alleged \nvictim and treats both parties fairly.  \n\u201cComplainant\u201d  \nThe Final Rule defines \u201ccomplainant\u201d as an individual who is alleged to be the \nvictim of conduct that could constitute sexual harassment. \u2010 T his clarifies that \nany third party as well as the complainant may report sexual harassment. \u2010 \nWhile parents and guardians do not become complainants (or respondents), the \nFinal Rule expressly recognizes the legal rights of parents and guardians to act \non behalf of parties (including by filing formal complaints) in Title IX matters.  \n\u201cRespondent\u201d  \nThe Final Rule defines \u201crespondent\u201d as an individual who has been reported to \nbe the perpetrator of conduct that could constitute sexual harassment.  \n\u201cFormal Complaint\u201d  \nThe Final Rule defines \u201cformal complaint\u201d as a document filed by a complainant \nor signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sexual harassment against a \nrespondent and requesting that the school investigate the allegation of sexual \nharassment and states:  \n\u2022  \no At the time of filing a formal complaint, a complainant must be \nparticipating in or attempting to participate in the education \nprogram or activity of the school with which the formal \ncomplaint is filed.  \n44 \no A formal complaint may be filed with the Title IX Coordinator in \nperson, by mail, or by electronic mail, by using the contact \ninformation required to be listed for the Title IX Coordinator \nunder the Final Rule, and by any additional method designated \nby the school. \no The phrase \u201cdocument filed by a complainant\u201d means a \ndocument or electronic submission (such as by e \u2010m ail or \nthrough an online portal provided for this purpose by the \nschool) that contains the complainant\u2019s physical or digital \nsignature, or otherwise indic ates that the complainant is the \nperson filing the formal complaint.  \no Where the Title IX Coordinator signs a formal complaint, the \nTitle IX Coordinator is not a complainant or a party during a \ngrievance process, and must comply with requirements for Title \nIX personnel to be free from conflicts and bias.  \n\u201cSupportive Measures\u201d  \nThe Final Rule defines \u201csupportive measures\u201d as individualized services \nreasonably available that are non \u2010p unitive, non \u2010d isciplinary, and not \nunreasonably burdensome to the other party while designed to ensure equal \neducational access, protect safety, or d eter sexual harassment.  \n\u2022  \no The Final Rule evaluates a school\u2019s selection of supportive \nmeasures and remedies based on what is not clearly \nunreasonable in light of the known circumstances, and does not \nsecond guess a school\u2019s disciplinary decisions, but requires the \nschool to offer supportive measures, and provide remedies to a \ncomplainant whenever a respondent is found responsible.  \n7. Grievance Process, General Requirements  \nThe Final Rule prescribes a consistent, transparent grievance process for \nresolving formal complaints of sexual harassment. Aside from hearings \n(see Issue #9 below), the grievance process prescribed by the Final Rule \napplies to all schools equally includin g K\u20101 2 schools and postsecondary \ninstitutions. The Final Rule states that a school\u2019s grievance process must:  \n45 \n\u2022  \no Treat complainants equitably by providing remedies any time a \nrespondent is found responsible, and treat respondents \nequitably by not imposing disciplinary sanctions without \nfollowing the grievance process prescribed in the Final Rule.  \no Remedies, which are required to be provided to a complainant \nwhen a respondent is found responsible, must be designed to \nmaintain the complainant\u2019s equal access to education and may \ninclude the same individualized services described in the Final \nRule as supportive measures; however, remedies need not be \nnon\u2010d isciplinary or non \u2010pun itive and need not avoid burdening \nthe respondent.  \no Require objective evaluation of all relevant evidence, \ninculpatory and exculpatory, and avoid credibility \ndeterminations based on a person\u2019s status as a complainant, \nrespondent, or witness.  \no Require Title IX personnel (Title IX Coordinators, investigators, \ndecision\u2010m akers, people who facilitate any informal resolution \nprocess) to be free from conflicts of interest or bias for or \nagainst complainants or respondents.  \no Training of Title IX personnel must include training on the \ndefinition of sexual harassment in the Final Rule, the scope of \nthe school\u2019s education program or activity, how to conduct an \ninvestigation and grievance process including hearings, appeals, \nand informal resolution processes, as applicable, and how to \nserve impartially, including by avoiding prejudgment of the \nfacts at issue, conflicts of interest, and bias.  \no A school must ensure that decision \u2010m akers receive training on \nany technology to be used at a live hearing.  \no A school\u2019s decision \u2010m akers and investigators must receive \ntraining on issues of relevance, including how to apply the rape \nshield protections provided only for complainants.  \no Include a presumption that the respondent is not responsible \nfor the alleged conduct until a determination regarding \nresponsibility is made at the conclusion of the grievance \nprocess. \n46 \no Recipients must post materials used to train Title IX personnel \non their websites, if any, or make materials available for \nmembers of the public to inspect.  \no Include reasonably prompt timeframes for conclusion of the \ngrievance process, including appeals and informal resolutions, \nwith allowance for short \u2010t erm, good cause delays or extensions \nof the timeframes.  \no Describe the range, or list, the possible remedies a school may \nprovide a complainant and disciplinary sanctions a school might \nimpose on a respondent, following determinations of \nresponsibility.  \no State whether the school has chosen to use the preponderance \nof the evidence standard, or the clear and convincing evidence \nstandard, for all formal complaints of sexual harassment \n(including where employees and faculty are respondents).  \no Describe the school\u2019s appeal procedures, and the range of \nsupportive measures available to complainants and \nrespondents.  \no A school\u2019s grievance process must not use, rely on, or seek \ndisclosure of information protected under a legally recognized \nprivilege, unless the person holding such privilege has waived \nthe privilege.  \no Any provisions, rules, or practices other than those required by \nthe Final Rule that a school adopts as part of its grievance \nprocess for handling formal complaints of sexual harassment, \nmust apply equally to both parties.  \n8. Investigations  \nThe Final Rule states that the school must investigate the allegations in \nany formal complaint and send written notice to both parties \n(complainants and respondents) of the allegations upon receipt of a \nformal complaint. During the grievance process and wh en investigating:  \n\u2022  \no The burden of gathering evidence and burden of proof must \nremain on schools, not on the parties.  \n47 \no Schools must provide equal opportunity for the parties to \npresent fact and expert witnesses and other inculpatory and \nexculpatory evidence.  \no Schools must not restrict the ability of the parties to discuss the \nallegations or gather evidence (e.g., no \u201cgag orders\u201d).  \no Parties must have the same opportunity to select an advisor of \nthe party\u2019s choice who may be, but need not be, an attorney.  \no Schools must send written notice of any investigative \ninterviews, meetings, or hearings.  \no Schools must send the parties, and their advisors, evidence \ndirectly related to the allegations, in electronic format or hard \ncopy, with at least 10 days for the parties to inspect, review, \nand respond to the evidence.  \no Schools must send the parties, and their advisors, an \ninvestigative report that fairly summarizes relevant evidence, in \nelectronic format or hard copy, with at least 10 days for the \nparties to respond.  \no Schools must dismiss allegations of conduct that do not meet \nthe Final Rule\u2019s definition of sexual harassment or did not occur \nin a school\u2019s education program or activity against a person in \nthe U.S. Such dismissal is only for Title IX purposes and does no t \npreclude the school from addressing the conduct in any manner \nthe school deems appropriate.  \no Schools may, in their discretion, dismiss a formal complaint or \nallegations therein if the complainant informs the Title IX \nCoordinator in writing that the complainant desires to \nwithdraw the formal complaint or allegations therein, if the \nrespondent is no  longer enrolled or employed by the school, or \nif specific circumstances prevent the school from gathering \nsufficient evidence to reach a determination.  \no Schools must give the parties written notice of a dismissal \n(mandatory or discretionary) and the reasons for the dismissal.  \no Schools may, in their discretion, consolidate formal complaints \nwhere the allegations arise out of the same facts.  \no The Final Rule protects the privacy of a party\u2019s medical, \npsychological, and similar treatment records by stating that \n48 \nschools cannot access or use such records unless the school \nobtains the party\u2019s voluntary, written consent to do so.  \n9. Hearings \nThe Final Rule adds provisions to the \u201clive hearing with cross \u2010\nexamination\u201d requirement for postsecondary institutions and clarifies \nthat hearings are optional for K \u20101 2 schools (and any other recipient that is \nnot a postsecondary institution).  \n1.  \na. Live Hearings and Cross -Examination for Postsecondary \nInstitutions  \nFor postsecondary institutions, the school\u2019s grievance process must \nprovide for a live hearing:  \n\uf0a7 At the live hearing, the decision \u2010m aker(s) must permit each \nparty\u2019s advisor to ask the other party and any witnesses all \nrelevant questions and follow \u2010up  questions, including those \nchallenging credibility.  \n\uf0a7 Such cross \u2010e xamination at the live hearing must be \nconducted directly, orally, and in real time by the party\u2019s \nadvisor of choice and never by a party personally. \n\uf0a7 At the request of either party, the recipient must provide \nfor the entire live hearing (including cross \u2010e xamination) to \noccur with the parties located in separate rooms with \ntechnology enabling the parties to see and hear each other.  \n\uf0a7 Only relevant cross \u2010e xamination and other questions may \nbe asked of a party or witness. Before a complainant, \nrespondent, or witness answers a cross \u2010ex amination or \nother question, the decision \u2010m aker must first determine \nwhether the question is relevant and  explain to the party\u2019s \nadvisor asking cross \u2010e xamination questions any decision to \nexclude a question as not relevant.  \n\uf0a7 If a party does not have an advisor present at the live \nhearing, the school must provide, without fee or charge to \nthat party, an advisor of the school\u2019s choice who may be, \nbut is not required to be, an attorney to conduct cross \u2010\nexamination on behalf of that party.  \n49 \n\uf0a7 If a party or witness does not submit to cross \u2010e xamination \nat the live hearing, the decision \u2010m aker(s) must not rely on \nany statement of that party or witness in reaching a \ndetermination regarding responsibility; provided, however, \nthat the decision \u2010ma ker(s) cannot draw an inference about \nthe determination regarding responsibility based solely on \na party\u2019s or witness\u2019s absence from the live hearing or \nrefusal to answer cross \u2010e xamination or other questions.  \n\uf0a7 Live hearings may be conducted with all parties physically \npresent in the same geographic location or, at the school\u2019s \ndiscretion, any or all parties, witnesses, and other \nparticipants may appear at the live hearing virtually.  \n\uf0a7 Schools must create an audio or audiovisual recording, or \ntranscript, of any live hearing.  \nb. Rape Shield Protections for Complainants  \nThe Final Rule provides rape shield protections for complainants (as \nto all recipients whether postsecondary institutions, K \u20101 2 schools, \nor others), deeming irrelevant questions and evidence about a \ncomplainant\u2019s prior sexual behavior unless offered to prove that \nsomeone other than the respondent committed the alleged \nmisconduct or offered to prove consent.  \n10. Standard of Evidence & Written Determination  \nThe Final Rule requires the school\u2019s grievance process to state whether \nthe standard of evidence to determine responsibility is the \npreponderance of the evidence standard or the clear and convincing \nevidence standard. The Final Rule makes each school\u2019s grievance process \nconsistent by requiring each school to apply the same standard of \nevidence for all formal complaints of sexual harassment whether the \nrespondent is a student or an employee (including faculty member).  \no The decision \u2010m aker (who cannot be the same person as the Title \nIX Coordinator or the investigator) must issue a written \ndetermination regarding responsibility with findings of fact, \nconclusions about whether the alleged conduct occurred, \nrationale for the result as to each allegation, any disciplinary \nsanctions imposed on the respondent, and whether remedies will \nbe provided to the complainant.  \n50 \no The written determination must be sent simultaneously to the \nparties along with information about how to file an appeal.  \n11. Appeals \nThe Final Rule states that a school must offer both parties an appeal from \na determination regarding responsibility, and from a school\u2019s dismissal of \na formal complaint or any allegations therein, on the following bases: \nprocedural irregularity that affect ed the outcome of the matter, newly \ndiscovered evidence that could affect the outcome of the matter, and/or \nTitle IX personnel had a conflict of interest or bias, that affected the \noutcome of the matter.  \no A school may offer an appeal equally to both parties on \nadditional bases.  \n12. Informal Resolution  \nThe Final Rule allows a school, in its discretion, to choose to offer and \nfacilitate informal resolution options, such as mediation or restorative \njustice, so long as both parties give voluntary, informed, written consent \nto attempt informal resolution. Any person who facilitates an informal \nresolution must be well trained. The Final Rule adds:  \no A school may not require as a condition of enrollment or \ncontinuing enrollment, or employment or continuing \nemployment, or enjoyment of any other right, waiver of the right \nto a formal investigation and adjudication of formal complaints of \nsexual harassmen t. Similarly, a school may not require the parties \nto participate in an informal resolution process and may not offer \nan informal resolution process unless a formal complaint is filed.  \no At any time prior to agreeing to a resolution, any party has the \nright to withdraw from the informal resolution process and \nresume the grievance process with respect to the formal \ncomplaint. \no Schools must not offer or facilitate an informal resolution process \nto resolve allegations that an employee sexually harassed a \nstudent. \n13. Retaliation Prohibited  \nThe Final Rule expressly prohibits retaliation.  \n51 \no Charging an individual with code of conduct violations that do \nnot involve sexual harassment, but arise out of the same facts \nor circumstances as a report or formal complaint of sexual \nharassment, for the purpose of interfering with any right or \nprivilege secured by Title IX constitutes retaliation.  \no The school must keep confidential the identity of complainants, \nrespondents, and witnesses, except as may be permitted by \nFERPA, as required by law, or as necessary to carry out a Title IX \nproceeding.  \no Complaints alleging retaliation may be filed according to a \nschool\u2019s prompt and equitable grievance procedures.  \no The exercise of rights protected under the First Amendment \ndoes not constitute retaliation.  \no Charging an individual with a code of conduct violation for \nmaking a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of \na Title IX grievance proceeding does not constitute retaliation; \nhowever, a determination regarding responsibility, alone, is not \nsufficient to conclude that any party made a bad faith \nmaterially false statement.  \nsource: U.S. Department of Education The Title IX Final Rule: Addressing Sexual \nHarassment in Schools  \nNon-Reporting \nVictims are strongly encouraged to report any incident of sexual misconduct, \ndating violence, domestic violence, or stalking to the police and/or campus Title \n\u2168 Coordinator so that steps may be taken to protect them and the rest of the \ncampus community. However, non\u2010r\neporting is also an option. \nCivil Lawsuit \nVictims may choose to file a civil lawsuit against the perpetrator, whether or not \ncriminal charges have been filed. A civil lawsuit provides the opportunity to \nrecover actual damages, which may include compensation for medical expenses, \nlost wages, pain, suffering and emotional distress. \n52 \nRestraining Orders \nVictims may also choose to obtain a protective or restraining order (such as a \ndomestic violence restraining order or a civil harassment restraining order). \nRestraining orders must be obtained from a court in the jurisdiction where the \nincident occurred. Restraining orders can protect victims who have experienced \nor are reasonably in fear of physical violence, sexual misconduct, dating violence, \ndomestic violence, or stalking. The campus Title \u2168 Coordinator or Sexual Assault \nVictim\u2019s Advocate can offer assistance with obtaining a protective or restraining \norder. \nEducational Programs and Outreach \nIn an ongoing effort to prevent sexual violence, dating violence, domestic violence \nand stalking, Las Positas College provides education and prevention programs, \ninvestigates complaints, dispenses corrective or disciplinary action where \nappropriate, provides referrals for medical care/counseling, modified classes, \nreduced course load, leaves of absence and more. Las Positas College also \nprovides information to victims and survivors on pursuing criminal action and \nobtaining protective orders if needed.  \nThe following is a summary of educational programming and outreach activities: \n\u201cNot Anymore\u201d Sexual Assault Prevention Training: The \u201cPrimary Prevention \nans Awarness Program\u201d, requirement for the Campus SAVE Act, (Sec. 304 of the \nVAWA\u2010 Violence Against Women Re\u2010Authorization Act of 2013).An interactive \nonline module required for all students of Las Positas College during orientation. \nThe educational modules focus on awareness of sexual misconduct by defining \nconsent sexual violence, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and \nbystander intervention. \n\u201cSexual Assault Awareness Month\u201d, The Student Health Center co\u2010sponsored \nwith local rape crisis Tri Valley Haven \u201cClothes Line & Denim Day\u201d in April of each \nyear to bring awareness to sexual assault and rape. Denim Day is a campaign to \nprevent sexual violence through education and public awareness.  April is Sexual \nAssault Awareness Month, and Denim Day is a call to action for all people to come \ntogether by wearing denim as a visible sign of protest against sexual violence. \nDenim Day was originally triggered by a ruling by the Italian Supreme Court where \na rape conviction was overturned because the justices felt that since the victim \n53 \nwas wearing tight jeans she must have helped her rapist remove her jeans, \nthereby implying consent.  The following day, the women in the Italian Parliament \ncame to work wearing jeans in solidarity with the victim.   \nThe clotheslines project is a partnership with Las Positas College and TriValley \nHaven rape crisis center.  The shirts are on display for the month of April in our \nstudent services building lobby. The shirts displayed are made by Las Positas \ncollege students and local community members.  On display is also information \nabout how to contact the local rape crisis center. \nThe clotheslines project originated in Hyannis, Massachusetts in 1990 when \nmembers of cape cod\u2019s Women\u2019s Defense Agenda learned that during the same \ntime 58,000 soldiers were killed in the Vietnam War, 51,000 U.S. women were \nkilled by men who claimed to love them.  The Clothesline is made up of t\u2010shirts \ncreated by survivors of violence, or created in honor of someone who has \nexperienced violence. It is a powerful witness of the violence many live with.  The \nproject began with 31 shirts.  \nThe Clothesline Project provides evidence that incest, domestic and sexual \nviolence exists in our communities.   \n\u201cBystander Intervention\" The bystander effect is a well\u2010known phenomenon in \nwhich the increased presence of witnesses or \u201cbystanders\u201d during a crisis actually \ndecreases the likelihood that someone will intervene. This is attributed to the \nassumption by most individuals that someone else will respond, thus justifying \ntheir hesitance or refusal to take action. The key to bystander intervention is the \nrecognition and acceptance that you might be the ONLY one that will act and you \nshould take measures to intervene in the interests of helping someone else, while \nassessing and taking precautions to protect your own safety and well\u2010being.  \nBystanders play a critical role in the prevention of sexual and relationship \nviolence. They are often the largest group of people involved \u2010 outnumbering \nboth the perpetrators and the victims. Bystanders can have a range of \ninvolvement in assaults. A person or persons may be aware that a specific assault \nis happening or will happen, they may see an assault or potential assault in \nprogress, or they may have knowledge that an assault has already occurred. \nRegardless of how close to the incident they are, bystanders have the power stop \nassaults and to get help for people who have been victimized. The Las Positas \n54 \nCollege Campus Safety department takes an active role in informing students and \nstaff throughout the year on the importance of taking action.  \n\u201c\nSafe Ride\u201d, The Department of Campus Safety and Security offers escorts to the \ncampus community to and from the parking lots.  To arrange to have an escort \naccompany you from your classroom or office to your vehicle, dial (925)424\u20101\n690 \nor extension 1690 from any college phone. \nOn and Off Campus Resources for Victims of Sexual Assaults \nOn Campus Resources \nTitle IX Coordinator                                                     \n\u2022 E\nmployee Concerns:                                                                                    \nWyman Fong                                                         \nVice Chancellor \n(925) 485\n\u20105\n235 \n\u2022 S\ntudent Discrimination Concerns: \nWilliam Garcia \nVice President Student Services \n\u2022 Bu\nilding 1600, Room 16 \n(510) 723\n\u20106\n717 \nS\ntudent Health center \n\u2022 (925) 424\u2010 18 30 or email us @ \ntgonsman@laspositascollege.edu  \n\u2022 Off Campus Resources \nMedical Assistance \nStudent Health Center Livermore (925424-1830 \nEden Medical Center Castro Valley (510) 537-1234 \nHighland Hospital Oakland (510) 437-4800 \nKaiser Hospital Pleasanton (925)) 8475050 \nValley Memorial Hospital  Livermore (925)447-7000 \nValley Care Medical  Pleasanton (925)847-3000 \n  ( \n55 \nCrisis Counseling & Shelters \nA Safe Place Oakland (510) 536-7233 \nAASRA (South Asian & Middle Eastern victims)   (800) 313-2772 \nAsian Women\u2019s Shelter  San Francisco (415) 751-0880 \nBay Area Women Against Rape (BAWAR)   (510) 845-7273 \nBattered Women\u2019s Alternatives  Concord (888) 215-5555 \nCalifornia Youth Crisis Line   (800) 843-5200 \nCenter for Domestic Violence Prevention  Burlingame (650) 312-8515 \nCrisis Line for the Handicapped   (800) 426-4263 \nLa Casa De Las Madres  San Francisco (415) 333-1515 \nNext Door  San Jose (408) 279-2962 \nRape Abuse Incest National Hotline (RAIN)   (800) 656-4673 \nSexual Assault Response Team (SART)  (925)416-3415 \nTri-Valley Haven for Women  Livermore (925) 449-5842 \nValley Community Health Center   (925)462-1755 \nCounseling Services \nCenter Phone Number \nAlameda County Alcohol and Drug Programs (510) 567-8100 \nAlameda County Mental Health (510) 795-2434 \nAsian Mental Health (510) 451-6729 \nCatholic Counseling (510) 886-1331 \nCommunity Counseling and Education Center (510) 792-4964 \nJewish Family Services (510) 704-7475 \nKaiser Psychiatry (510) 441-3080 \nLa Familia (510) 881-5921 \nParental Stress Service (800) 829-3777 \nSor Juana Ines (Spanish) (800) 300-1080 \nLegal Assistance and Victim Compensation  \nCenter Phone Number \nAlameda County District Attorney\u2019s Office (510) 670-5100 \nAlameda County Legal Services Project (510) 663-0750 \nAlameda County Victim Witness Program (510) 272-6180 \nDomestic Violence Law Project (510) 733-2071 \nLegal Aid Society of Alameda County (510) 538-6507 \nVolunteer Legal Services (510) 893-1031 \n56 \nCounseling Services \nThe Las Positas College Counseling Division provides essential support services to \na diverse student population by offering an array of programs, classes and \ncounseling services.

Short\u2010term \ncounseling may be provided through personal counseling appointments in the \ncounseling center and/or student health center and/or referring students to \nappropriate community resources. All registered Las Positas College students are \neligible to receive free personal counseling sessions via the Student Health and \nCounseling Center during their college career. \nPolicy for Campus Disciplinary Action in Sexual Violence Cases \nThe College is required to promptly and equitably respond to all reports of \nProhibited Conduct under Title IX, which prohibits discrimination in educational \ninstitutions based on sex or gender, including through sexual harassment and \nsexual assault.  \nApproximate Duration: 60 calendar days, with the possibility of extension under \ncertain conditions. Decision\u2010Making Process: The Title IX Coordinator will issue a \nfinal Outcome Letter based on the findings of the investigation.  \nSummary of the investigation and review process:  \nWhen a determination is made to proceed with a Title IX investigation, the Title IX \nCoordinator will investigate or will assign an investigator or investigators.  \n\u2022 This Title IX investigation procedure will determine findings of fact using the \n\u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard (i.e. it is more likely than not that the \nProhibited Conduct occurred).  \n57 \n\u2022 At the onset of an investigation, the investigator will advise the Respondent \nof the allegations against him or her, in writing, in the form of a Notice of \nInvestigation, and this notice will be provided to the Impacted Party.  \n\u2022 Both the Respondent and the Impacted Party will have an opportunity to \nrespond to the Notice of Investigation in writing and in a meeting with the \ninvestigator. Both parties have the right to request that the investigator meet \nwith relevant witnesses and evaluate relevant documentary or other evidence.  \n\u2022 Students may have a support person accompany him or her through the \nprocess. A support person may not speak for the student.  \n\u2022 The investigator has broad discretion in determining whether an offered \nwitness or documentary evidence would be relevant or helpful to a \ndetermination.  \n\u2022 In the event the investigator is not the Title IX Coordinator, the investigator \nmay provide a written report to the Title IX Coordinator, as appropriate to assist \nthe decision maker or decision makers. In such cases, the Title IX Coordinator will \nreview the report and may request further review from the investigator, or may \nask for additional information directly from parties or witnesses.  \n\u2022 The decision\u2010maker is either the Title IX Coordinator or the Title IX \nCoordinator and an academic member (in cases in which the accused is a faculty \nmember) or an HR representative (in cases in which the accused is a staff \nmember).  \n\u2022 Upon completion of the investigation and review of all materials, the Title \nIX Coordinator or designee will issue each party a written Outcome Letter \nincluding findings of fact, and if applicable, any actions the College will take to \nprovide accommodations to the Impacted Party, or safety measure(s) for the \nCollege community. The letter will also describe whether any systemic remedies \nare being considered or implemented. An Outcome Letter will be provided to \nboth parties, although the content of each letter may be modified subject to the \nlimitations of FERPA and other relevant federal or state privacy laws. Where \nProhibited Conduct has been found to have occurred by the Respondent, the \nOutcome Letter will be provided to the Respondent\u2019s supervisor, HR manager, or \nDean, as appropriate under the circumstances.  \n\u2022 Both parties to a Title IX investigation may appeal the outcome.  \n58 \nStudent Conduct and Due Process Policy \n Las Positas College encourages all students to pursue academic studies and other \ncollege\u2010sponsored activities. In pursuit of these goals, the student should be free \nof unfair or improper action from any member of the academic community. The \nDistrict accords every student the right or protection. Students, however, are \nresponsible for complying with college and district regulations and for meeting \nthe appropriate college requirements. The Colleges have an obligation to \nmaintain conditions under which the work of the colleges can go forward freely, \nin accordance with the highest standards of quality, institutional integrity and \nfreedom of expression. In joining the academic community, the student enjoys \nthe right of freedom to learn and shares responsibility in exercising that freedom. \nA student is expected to conduct himself or herself in accordance with standards \nof the college.  \nWhen a student is charged with misconduct such charge shall be processed in \naccordance with the district policy and procedure in order to protect the \nstudent's rights and the college\u2019s interest. Disciplinary action may be imposed on \na student for violation of law, district and college policy and regulations, the \nEducation Code and the Administrative Code. Provisions related to disciplinary \naction shall be published and available to students, faculty and management staff \nStudent conduct may result in disciplinary action by the college and/or criminal \nprosecution. It is the policy of the district not to impose student discipline for acts \noccurring away from the college and not connected with college activities, unless \nthe student's conduct affects the functions of the college. \nSummary of Conduct Prohibited by the Code \nA college student may be expelled, suspended, placed on probation or given a \nlesser sanction for good cause and in accordance with procedures consistent with \ndue process.

It\u2019s a strategy to grant students\n                        credit for what they already know and can do. Credit for Prior Learning is most often\n                        awarded by exam, portfolio, industry training, and/or military joint service training\n                        / experience, but can also be awarded by satisfactory passing of the AP, IB, or CLEP\n                        exam.\nA currently enrolled Las Positas College student in good academic standing with an\n                        educational plan on file may be awarded credit for prior learning with faculty consent.\nAbout Credit for Prior Learning (CPL)\nHow does it support our students?\nCredit for Prior Learning supports our students by v\nalidating work and learning they've already completed, aiding in the swifter movement\n                           through thier pathway/program resulting in greater degree completions, promoting equity,\n                           a\nvoiding repetition of courses,\nand helping working adults\u00a0reskill and achieve quality credentials that increase their\n                           economic mobility and create closer communications with industry experts which benefits\n                           their community.\nHow does it benefit our college?\nCredit for Prior Learning benefits Las Positas College by creating o\npen space for future community and industry partnerships,\nbuilding enrollment by\u00a0supporting student retention and persistence, and respecting\n                           students and their work by\u00a0reducing the time to graduation and assuring quality and\n                           equity across various academic experiences.\nDid you know?

Courses can get the Low Cost Textbook label if the textbooks cost less\n                                    than $50.\nHere are some ways instructors have lowered or removed textbook costs:\nNo required textbook\nTextbooks are optional\nTextbooks are free for students, through lending services or online (e-books)\nUsing a free, open educational resource (OER) textbook\nProviding a class set of textbooks that all students can use\nUsing free readings from websites or online databases\nInstructors should tell their departments if their course qualifies for either label\n                                    when they are planning the schedule.\nThe college tries to make sure that the ZTC (Zero Textbook Cost) and LTC (Low Cost\n                                    Textbook) labels in the class schedule are correct. However, sometimes things change.\n                                    For example, a book might become unavailable, or an instructor might need to choose\n                                    a different textbook, which could change the cost of course materials.\nSometimes, the instructor for a class might also change. New instructors have the\n                                    right to choose their own textbooks, even if they cost more, and they don\u2019t have to\n                                    use the free or low-cost materials previously chosen.\nPlease check the textbook information for your course as the start date gets closer,\n                                    especially if the instructor has changed.\nThe total cost of required textbooks must be less than $50. The price used is the\n                                    lowest pre-tax cost available to all students at the campus bookstore. For physical\n                                    books, this usually means the NEW price, because used or rental copies might not be\n                                    available for everyone. If a digital rental or purchase option is available and a\n                                    physical book is not required, then that digital price can be used.\nYou have the option to print the digital materials provided to you, and sometimes\n                                    your instructor may require you to do so. If a class uses free digital materials but\n                                    asks students to print some of them, it can still be labeled as Low Textbook Cost\n                                    if the printing costs are expected to be under the $50 limit. However, if you choose\n                                    to print materials on your own, those costs don\u2019t count as part of this program.\nChoosing to explore Open Educational Resources (OER) for your class is a great decision\n                                    because it can give your students quality educational content at little or no cost.\n                                    Here are some well-known platforms and collections where you can start searching for\n                                    OER:\nASCCC Curated OER Collections\n:\nOER collections for California Community Colleges, organized by subject, CSU general\n                                       education requirements, Transfer Model Curricula, and C-ID, plus a summary of any\n                                       gaps in OER.\nLibreTexts\n:\nA platform where faculty can find, customize, and use resources across different\n                                       subjects.\nOpenStax:\nA nonprofit organization that provides free, peer-reviewed, openly licensed college\n                                       textbooks for many introductory courses.\nOASIS (Openly Available Sources Integrated Search)\n:\nA tool for finding free, peer-reviewed, openly licensed college textbooks for many\n                                       introductory courses.\nProfessional Networks:\nColleagues in your department or professional groups may already know about OER resources\n                                       that are good for your class.\nWhen looking at resources, of course think about the quality and fit, but also look\n                                    at the licensing (to make sure you can use it as you plan), and any reviews or data\n                                    on how it\u2019s been used before. Switching to OER might require some adjustments, but\n                                    it can be very helpful for students by reducing costs and providing immediate access\n                                    to materials!\nIf you plan to move your class or department towards ZTC (Zero Textbook Cost), there\n                                    are funds available to support you.
